ONE OF OUR YOUNG BOROUGHS.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Chelmsford</span>, one of the youngest of
the Essex Boroughs, and almost a suburb of Greater London by
means of the Great Eastern Railway, was, when I first knew it, a
dignified county town, the leading people of which considered a
second post from London as a daily nuisance, and had no taste for
what is practically too near the rush and roar of modern
life.&nbsp; The old stage-coaches stopped and changed horses at
quaint old hotels, which have long disappeared.&nbsp; Now, as you
drop down from the railway station, past the Quakers&rsquo;
chapel on one side, and the big brewery on the other, all is
modern, and except the church which stands on your left, there is
little left to recall the past.&nbsp; In the square, opposite the
Shire Hall, there is a modern statue which recalls to memory
Chief Justice Tindal, who, born in 1776, at a house called Coval
Hall, was educated at the Chelmsford Grammar School, and died at
Folkestone, in 1846.&nbsp; The statue is erected on the <a
name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>site of an
ancient conduit, which stood long upon the spot, with a Latin
inscription which few Essex people cared to read.&nbsp; Not far
off is the Corn Exchange, which, what time corn was a commodity
worth dealing in, was on Fridays as busy as Mark Lane itself.</p>
<p>But on the whole the town is modern, and all of the modern
time.&nbsp; It is respectable, thoroughly so, quite as much as
any London square or street.&nbsp; Its great industry is a modern
one&mdash;the manufacture of Electric apparatus, by the firm of
Crompton and Co., Ltd., a firm which has for some time occupied a
leading place in connection with the installation of Electric
light, and has been the means of lighting not only Chelmsford,
but many of the principal buildings in London.&nbsp; If you want
to see antiquity in Chelmsford, you must pay a visit to the
Museum, now incorporated with the Essex Field Club, which is a
very good one of its kind.&nbsp; One of the best antiquarian
magazines of the day is the <i>Essex Review</i>, published in
High street, which is really a credit to the town.&nbsp; But
Chelmsford is of the present rather than the past.&nbsp; Its men
and women move with the times, perhaps in consequence of their
nearness to the great metropolis.&nbsp; It has literary and
scientific tastes, of which the sette of Odde Volumes is an
illustration; and it is further known to fame as the
head-quarters of the Essex Bee-keeping Association, established
in 1880, which has done much to develop the taste for, and the
growth of, honey&mdash;an article not unknown to the ancients,
and an industry by means of which many a careful cottager may pay
his rent.&nbsp; Of that association Mr. Edmund Durrant is the
life and soul, and in all parts of the land he has lifted up his
voice, on behalf of this new and desirable source of wealth in
our country towns and village homes.&nbsp; As to its Beef Steak
Club, which was founded in Chelmsford in the time of the
Georges&mdash;it was second to none.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The position of the town at the junction of the rivers
Chelmer and Cann probably&rdquo; writes Mr. Christy, &ldquo;led
to its being inhabited in very early days.&rdquo;&nbsp; As Roman
remains have been discovered there, there is <a
name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>reason to
suppose that it was known to those enterprising people.</p>
<p>In the good old times, as some people call them, there was a
Priory here (of which no trace now remains), where in the reign
of Edward II. resided Thomas Langford, an author, of whose works
I know little, save that a local historian describes them as
curious.&nbsp; A greater man, I apprehend, was Philemon Holland,
a physician and translator of Livy, Pliny, and other classic
authors.&nbsp; He has better claims on us as having first
translated Camden&rsquo;s Britannia into English.&nbsp; He was
born in Chelmsford, in 1551, and educated at the Grammar School,
a school which still exists, but in a recent building, the older
one having passed into the hands of the County Council Technical
Instruction Committee.&nbsp; One of the old houses still
remaining, &ldquo;Springfield Mill,&rdquo; is that in which
Strutt wrote his Sports and Pastimes.</p>
<p>Chelmsford fell into Church hands at an early date: It owes
indeed much of its prosperity to Maurice, Bishop of London, who,
about the year 1100, built a bridge over the Cann, which brought
the main stream of traffic through Chelmsford instead of
Writtle.</p>
<p>The Church has been once at any rate in danger, that is in
1800, when a great part of the building fell down.&nbsp; Hence
arose a well-known local rhyme.</p>
<blockquote><p>Chelmsford Church, and Writtle steeple,<br />
Both fell down, but killed no people.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Chelmsford seems early to have struggled after a Reformed
Church.&nbsp; Strype tells us of one, William Maldon, who learned
to read in order that he might study the Bible for himself, and
there discovered how idolatrous it was to kneel to the crucifix,
much to the anger of his father, who beat him till he was almost
dead.&nbsp; A little later we hear of George Eagles, who, for
preaching, was hanged, drawn and quartered at Chelmsford, in
Queen Mary&rsquo;s reign, and whose head was set up in the
market-place on a long pole.&nbsp; Archbishop Laud found many
victims in Essex.&nbsp; <a name="page4"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 4</span>One was Thomas Hooker, Fellow of
Emanuel College, Cambridge, and lecturer at Chelmsford, where by
his preaching he wrought a great reformation, not only in the
town but in all the country round.&nbsp; Happily for himself,
Hooker escaped to America, where he died.&nbsp; When the Quakers
appeared, they were sorely handled by those who ought to have
known better; for instance, in July 1655, there was a day of
general fasting, prayer, and public collection of money for the
poor persecuted Protestants of Piedmont.&nbsp; John Parnell, the
Quaker, embraced that opportunity for disturbing the people, and
for this he was tried at Chelmsford, and sent to Colchester
Castle where he died.&nbsp; One of the ejected ministers at
Chelmsford, Mark Mott, is described as an able preacher.&nbsp;
The congregational cause in Chelmsford, dates from the time of
John Reeve, who took out a license for a Presbyterian
Meeting-house, in 1692.&nbsp; Edward Rogers, an ejected minister,
succeeded him.&nbsp; Before the year 1716, a meeting-house had
been erected, and at that time a separation took place, which led
to the erection of another meeting-house.&nbsp; In 1716, the
pastor at the old meeting was Nathaniel Hickford.&nbsp; The
congregation then consisted of seven hundred hearers, of whom
twenty are described as having votes for the county, and eighteen
as gentlemen.&nbsp; The first pastor at the new meeting was
Richard, the father of the well-known Nathaniel Lardner.&nbsp; In
1763, the two churches united, but not long after they separated
again.&nbsp; The new meeting, which is still in the London road,
was for some time under the pastoral care of the Rev. George
Wilkinson, but lately resigned, and his place is filled by the
Rev. MacDougal Mundle, whose popularity argues well for the cause
with which he is connected, and the church over which he
presides.</p>
<p>For another thing the Chelmsford of the past was
distinguished, and that was by a mock election, a very proper
thing, when election was a farce, and not as now, the opportunity
of the free and independent democracy to utter their political
opinions, and to send the wisest of the wise and the purest of
patriots to Westminster <a name="page5"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 5</span>as Members of Parliament.&nbsp; An
election is no farce now when the eyes of all England are on the
electors, and orators from every corner of the land come to call
on the electors to do their duty.&nbsp; In old times men were
merry, and made fun even of an election; at any rate they did
this in Chelmsford, where at every county election, a mock
contest was held on a small island between the two rivers known
as Mesopotamia, (that blessed word, as the old woman said when
she heard it in the course of her favourite parson&rsquo;s
sermon).&nbsp; At this mock election, we are told, after the
successful candidate was chaired with every mark of honour, he
was ducked in the stream.&nbsp; Sometimes one wishes that old
customs were revived, I know at any rate more than one candidate,
who if he were ducked in the stream, and left there, would be
little missed by an enlightened public such as we have in this
present age.</p>
<h2><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>II.<br
/>
IN AN ANCIENT CITY.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">About</span> fifty miles away from
London&mdash;you can run down in an hour by the Great
Eastern&mdash;stands an ancient, if not the most ancient, city in
England, where the mother of Constantine is said to have lived,
where, at any rate, she founded a chapel, which still remains,
and where Constantine the Great is said to have been born, and
where old King Cole, that merry old soul, is reported to have
reigned in all his glory.&nbsp; It was built by the Roman
Claudius, <span class="GutSmall">A.D.</span>, 44.&nbsp; It boasts
an old castle, which was terribly damaged by Cromwell&rsquo;s
soldiers when they took it after a severe siege, in which the
inhabitants suffered terrible privations.&nbsp; It has an ancient
priory in ruins, but which is deeply interesting to antiquarians;
and it contains old houses and winding streets, which are ever a
delight and wonder to the intelligent of the rising
generation.&nbsp; Colchester, of which I write, is a busy place,
and moves with the times.&nbsp; As you look at it from the Great
Eastern Railway, which sweeps around its base, it seems a city
set upon a hill; and in the old coaching days, when we drove
along its High street, now handsomer than ever, it was a great
relief in the summer time, when we stopped there to change
horses, after a long and dusty ride, to buy some of the fruits
and flowers offered for sale, and for the production of which the
country round is famous.&nbsp; The Colchester <a
name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>people have a
fine appreciation of their ancient and prosperous town, the
streets of which are alive with military.&nbsp; There is a large
camp here, the gallant men of which seem to have a due
appreciation of the fine complexion and healthy figures of the
Essex servant girls.&nbsp; It has its park and its promenades, a
river which is rich in commerce and famed for its oysters, and if
not quite up to the standard of Dr. W. B. Richardson, I must give
its municipal authorities credit for doing the best they can, to
bring it up to our modern ideas of sanitary excellence.&nbsp; It
has lately taken to making shoes in the swiftest manner possible,
and threatens to be a formidable rival to Northampton, and
assuredly, when I hear of the money made by many of its citizens,
who, starting with the proverbial half-crown, have now
accumulated handsome fortunes, I feel justified in asserting that
grass does not grow in its streets.</p>
<p>The religious history of Colchester is deeply
interesting.&nbsp; That unfortunate Puritan, Bastwicke lived at
the Red House, Red Lane.&nbsp; Matthew Newcomen, one of the
Puritan divines who took part in the Smectymnian Controversy, was
the son of a rector of Trinity.&nbsp; His brother Thomas, a
Royalist, lived to be a Prebendary at Lincoln at the
Restoration.&nbsp; Colchester has done much for
Nonconformity.&nbsp; It was one of the earliest cities to do
battle for religious freedom and the rights of conscience.&nbsp;
As far back as 1428 we find the keeper of Colchester Castle
empowered to search out and imprison persons suspected of
&ldquo;heresie or Lollardie.&rdquo;&nbsp; In Queen Mary&rsquo;s
days fourteen men and eight women were brought from Colchester to
London like a flock of sheep, but bound or chained together, to
appear before Bonner, on account of religion; but several were
burnt there at different times.&nbsp; The first certain account
of the Baptists of Colchester is that of Thomas Lamb, about the
year 1630, who was one of the victims of Archbishop Laud.&nbsp;
For some time Baptists and P&aelig;do-Baptists seem to have
worshipped together here; they <a name="page8"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 8</span>in time separated, and the present
flourishing cause, under Rev. E. Spurrier, celebrated its
bi-centenary last year.&nbsp; From a MS. account in Dr.
Williams&rsquo;s library, we learn that in 1715 there were three
Non-conformist congregations in Colchester&mdash;one Independant,
one Presbyterian (with a total of 1,500 hearers), and one Baptist
(with 200).&nbsp; In the schoolroom of the Baptist church at
Eld-street is a fine portrait of the Captain Murrell whose noble
rescue of a shipwrecked crew in a stormy sea was the admiration
of the whole civilised world a year or two since.&nbsp; And it
rightly hangs there, for as a boy he was brought up in its
Sunday-school.&nbsp; Close to the Baptist church in Eld-lane is
the well-known Congregational church, a new and handsome
structure, of which Rev. T. Robinson is the pastor.</p>
<p>Let me now take the reader to another Congregational
church&mdash;that of Stockwell, of which the Rev. Thomas Batty is
the present pastor.&nbsp; It looks uncommonly well, considering
how often it has been altered and enlarged.&nbsp; Like all the
other Nonconformist places of worship in Colchester, it is
situated in an out-of-the-way part of the town.&nbsp; The old
Noncons were too much given to set their light under a bushel,
but there were reasons for that which happily do not exist
now.&nbsp; But it is worth while looking at the place if only for
the sake of seeing the monument to Mr. Herrick, the famous
Independent parson, who preached there for fifty years.&nbsp; It
is said of him that whilst his preaching <i>regaled the
highest</i> intellect, the common people heard him gladly.&nbsp;
The present occupier of the pulpit, who has been there
twenty-five years, seems destined to achieve fame in many
ways.&nbsp; One of his latest inventions is a fire-globe, for
warming rooms.</p>
<p>There were, to me, two specially interesting ecclesiastical
edifices in Colchester.&nbsp; One now utilised for industrial
purposes, almost side by side with Mr. Batty&rsquo;s chapel, was
erected in 1691 for Nonconformist worship.&nbsp; It was there
Isaac Taylor preached, and there his <a name="page9"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 9</span>celebrated daughters attended.&nbsp;
Their dwelling-house is close by, and there they wrote those
charming poems and tales for infants&rsquo; minds which are
popular in the nursery still.&nbsp; It was there Isaac Taylor, of
Ongar, learned to think, so as to become one of the foremost
essayists of his age.&nbsp; As you stand outside and look at the
roof of the old tabernacle you will see that some part of it is
more modern than the rest.&nbsp; It appears there was an orthodox
minister whose preaching was not acceptable to the Unitarian part
of the congregation.&nbsp; He would not go, and they resolved to
make him, and to compel him to move they took off part of the
roof.&nbsp; The preacher, however, remained, and the small
endowment with him, which has been transferred to Mr.
Batty&rsquo;s church over the way.&nbsp; The other ecclesiastical
edifice to which I allude is a small Episcopalian church of
ancient date, which contains the tomb of the celebrated Dr.
Gilberd.&nbsp; But the great lion of Colchester is, of course,
its castle, now utilised as a museum, full of interesting Roman
remains found in the neighbourhood, and to which they are
constantly being brought, as almost every excavation in the city
disinters something or other left by those rulers of the ancient
world.&nbsp; In the castle is an interesting library, left to the
city by Bishop Harsnett, a Colchester lad who became a great
man&mdash;Archbishop of York, if I remember aright&mdash;but who
in his old age was sadly worried by the Puritans.&nbsp; Some of
the books are in excellent preservation, and are marvels of
typography.&nbsp; I was especially struck with one,
&ldquo;Meditationes Vite Jesu Christi,&rdquo; printed at
Strasbourg in 1483.&nbsp; No printer in our day could surpass
such work.&nbsp; We have gained much, but our old masters are our
old masters still.&nbsp; It is interesting to note that the
library is used by Mr. Round, one of the Essex M.P.&rsquo;s, for
a Bible-class on Sunday afternoons.</p>
<p>Of the many distinguished natives of Colchester, I have
already mentioned the Newcomens.&nbsp; Another famous name
connected with the town is that of Daniel Whittle Harvey, a great
man in London on <a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>the Liberal side, and, perhaps, still remembered by the
joke in <i>Punch</i>, where, when a cabman asks another what the
V.R. on his badge implied, replied, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Vittle
Harvey to be sure.&rdquo;&nbsp; He commenced his career as
articled clerk to a Colchester solicitor, and very early
developed a considerable talent for public speaking.&nbsp; He
became a somewhat ardent Radical, and was so zealous at public
meetings in favour of Reform that he was induced in 1812 to
contest the borough, but was defeated by the Conservatives.&nbsp;
&ldquo;His determination and perseverance,&rdquo; writes Mr.
Charles Benham in his <i>Colchester Worthies</i>, &ldquo;urged
him not to abandon his attempts, which were afterwards more
successful, and he was several times returned at the head of the
poll.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was subsequently appointed by the
Corporation of London, Chief Commissioner of the City
Police.&nbsp; He held that office simultaneously with his seat in
Parliament until the passing of the new Police Act, when he was
no longer eligible for his seat in Parliament, which he
relinquished in 1834, maintaining his official appointment till
his death, which was about 1864.&nbsp; Colchester has supplied
London with two Lord Mayors&mdash;one of them, Sir Thomas White,
was Lord Mayor of London in 1553.&nbsp; He received the honour of
Knighthood for preserving the peace of the city in Wyatt&rsquo;s
Rebellion.&nbsp; He made various benefactions in different towns,
including Colchester, in 1566.&nbsp; The second was David
Williams Wire, who was in D. W. Harvey&rsquo;s office in his
youth, and was one of the first Dissenters to become Lord
Mayor.&nbsp; He died in 1860, and was buried at Lewisham.</p>
<p>Science owes not a little to natives of Colchester.&nbsp; One
of the most distinguished of them was Dr. William Gilbert, born
in 1540.&nbsp; The house in Colchester where he received Queen
Elizabeth as a guest remains to this day, and a very attractive
old house it is.&nbsp; He was chief physician to the Queen, who
valued him highly, and wonderful to say, allowed him an annual
sum to encourage him in his studies.&nbsp; He was also chief
physician to James I.&nbsp; In 1600 he published his famous <a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>book,
&ldquo;De Magnete,&rdquo; the first work ever written on
electricity.&nbsp; It indicates great sagacity on the part of the
writer.&nbsp; The word electric was first given to the world in
it.&nbsp; He also wrote a learned work about the world, which was
published at Amsterdam after his death.&nbsp; In all
English-American and Continental Pharmacop&oelig;ias we have Dr.
Griffiths&rsquo; mixture reproduced under the title of <i>Mixtura
ferri composita</i>.&nbsp; It was in a work published at
Colchester by Dr. Moses Griffiths that that prescription
originally appeared.&nbsp; It is still frequently used.&nbsp;
Only the other day, as it were, a celebrated, fashionable and
wealthy surgeon died at the West end of London.&nbsp; I refer to
Sir William Gull, the son of a Colchester mariner, who ultimately
moved to Thorpe, near Clacton, where the son was brought up at a
village school.&nbsp; He chose to be a schoolmaster, and assisted
for a time at a Colchester seminary.&nbsp; He then went to be
usher in a school at Lewes, where he developed great scientific
tastes, which gained for him a post at Guy&rsquo;s Hospital in
connection with cataloguing the Museum.&nbsp; This led him to
devote his attention to medicine, and having commenced practice,
he soon rose to distinction.&nbsp; He attended the Prince of
Wales, in conjunction with Sir William Jenner, throughout a
dangerous attack of typhus fever, and was rewarded with a
baronetcy.&nbsp; He died in 1890, and was buried at Thorpe, where
there is a handsome monument to his memory.&nbsp; Nor in this
catalogue of Colchester natives would we fail to omit the
ladies.&nbsp; Let us give the first place to the far-famed
Margaret, Duchess of Newcastle, daughter of Charles Lucas, and
born at Colchester.&nbsp; There were highly educated and gifted
women then as now, and the fair Margaret early exhibited a taste
for literature.&nbsp; She became the second wife of William
Cavendish, Duke of Newcastle, to whom she was married in
1645.&nbsp; Two years previously she visited the Court of Charles
I., then at Oxford.&nbsp; She was appointed one of the Maids of
Honour to the Queen Henrietta Maria, and accompanied her Majesty
to France.&nbsp; She published ten volumes of
letters&mdash;plays, poems, <a name="page12"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 12</span>philosophical discourse, and the life
of her husband the Duke.&nbsp; Her town residence was in
Clerkenwell, a more fashionable locality at that time than it is
to-day.&nbsp; The lady was certainly eccentric, but she is said
to have been distinguished by pious and charitable works, and for
them, perhaps as much as for her literary talent, deserves her
tomb in Westminster Abbey, where she was buried in 1673.</p>
<p>Colchester contains a population of 34,549, and is connected
by railway with most of the towns of the district.&nbsp; By means
of its river Colne it is also a port, and has fine oyster beds,
where the &ldquo;Colchester Natives&rdquo; are reared, which are
celebrated all the world over.&nbsp; Its oyster feast is one of
the most famous institutions of the place, though who was the
Mayor who founded the feast is lost in the mists of
antiquity.&nbsp; After the oyster-spatting season is over, that
is about the middle of September, the Corporation holds a meeting
on board a boat in the river, and proclaims the fishery to be
open.&nbsp; The fishing is a source of profit to the
Corporation.&nbsp; In the warm seasons&mdash;that was before 1870
(immense numbers of oysters were produced in 1865)&mdash;they
realised as much as &pound;18,318, the price being &pound;4 a
bushel.&nbsp; Since then, from the greater scarcity of oysters,
and the enlarged market for them due to railway facilities,
prices have been &pound;12 and &pound;14 for the same quantity,
and it is at that price, I believe, they are now sold.&nbsp; The
Colne fishery is about four miles and a half in extent; it
contains the best fattening grounds in the kingdom, and the River
Colne itself is one of the best spatting grounds in the district
producing native oysters.&nbsp; We call them native, because so
many oysters come from Holland and elsewhere, and are merely
fattened in English waters.&nbsp; In London, when you buy a
native, you are not sure that you get the genuine article.&nbsp;
At the Colchester feast the Mayor treats you to the native in all
its primitive beauty and simplicity.&nbsp; I own the oyster is
not lovely to look at, and the sight of a hall filled with rows
of tables, on which were placed plates containing a dozen for
each <a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>guest, with glasses of stout or bottles of Chablis or
Sauterne, lacks somewhat of the warmth of colour to which we are
more or less accustomed in our civic feasts in town.&nbsp; It
must also be remembered that these entertainments take place by
night, when the gas sparkles in a hundred chandeliers.&nbsp; At
Colchester the hour of the feast is 2 p.m., and oysters and
stout, place them how you will, cannot be made to look
picturesque.&nbsp; At one time these Colchester feasts were
confined to the members of the Corporation and the
officials.&nbsp; That custom has been changed for a better one,
and many of the principal citizens and others are bidden to the
feast.&nbsp; Strangers are also invited, and I have to thank more
than one worthy Mayor for favouring me with an invitation.&nbsp;
It is the privilege of the Mayor of Colchester for the time being
to provide for all the expenses of the feast except a portion of
the oysters, which are found by the Fishery Board, and the Mayor
sends out all the invitations.&nbsp; The feast always takes place
about October 22nd.&nbsp; Those who do not care for oysters had
better stop away, as little else besides oysters and brown bread
and butter is provided.&nbsp; Only a few ham sandwiches were
added, but the oyster was, as it deserved to be, the staple of
the feast; and I fancy most of us managed to consume about a
couple of dozen each.&nbsp; It may be that others exceeded that
moderate allowance, but in neither eating nor drinking was there
any sign of excess.&nbsp; There was a time when oysters and stout
were connected with Bacchanalian orgies.&nbsp; That time,
happily, has long passed, and instead we listened to oratory as
we smoked the meditative cigar or the Lilliputian cigarette, or
gazed with an admiring eye on the tasteful way in which the hall
had been prepared for the occasion.&nbsp; Music also lent its
charms.&nbsp; Colchester is a garrison town, and at present the
Royal Munster Fusiliers hold the fort.&nbsp; It was their band
that played on the occasion, with great applause.&nbsp; It was
not pleasant to turn out of the hall, which had begun to grow
additionally cheerful in consequence of the gas, <a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>and to make
one&rsquo;s way along the wet and deserted streets of the ancient
town.&nbsp; I need not add that I was all the better for what I
had eaten and heard.&nbsp; There are delicate questions, worthy
of any abler intellect than mine to settle, as to the proper way
of eating an oyster.&nbsp; According to some theories, you should
take the Great Eastern to Burnham, get on board a fishing-smack,
and gulp down the delicious bivalve as he comes fresh and juicy
from his watery bed.&nbsp; Others there are who contend for the
same operation on the River Colne; and I have met with low-minded
people who say that no oyster eats so pleasantly as that
purchased at a common street stall, as the vendor has less
capital than the regular dealer, and thus lays in a fresher stock
as he requires them.&nbsp; If I consult my old friend Sir Henry
Thompson, the great authority in such matters, I read,
&ldquo;Oysters are in fact the first dish of dinner and not its
precursor; the preface and not the possibly obtrusive
advertisement.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;It is,&rdquo; he remarks,
&ldquo;a single service of exquisite quality served with
attendant graces.&rdquo;&nbsp; Sir Henry evidently has never been
to a Colchester oyster feast, or he would have had a word to say
in its favour.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is not worth going to,&rdquo; said
a gentleman to me one day.&nbsp; Yet when I entered the hall
shortly after he was the first to come and shake hands with me,
and on that dull, rainy day he had travelled many miles to be at
the oyster feast.&nbsp; The fact is, in dull days one is glad of
any excuse for going out and having a chat with one&rsquo;s
friends, and it does one good to hear bishops and Dissenting
ministers, as they did at Colchester, talk in favour of Christian
unity, or the local M.P.&rsquo;s talk of national ditto, or the
mayors of the leading Essex towns vindicate that local
self-government which we all hold to be an important element in
the preservation and expansion of our national life.</p>

A QUIET SUFFOLK TOWN.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">One</span> of the oldest towns in Suffolk
is Hadleigh.&nbsp; You take the train at Liverpool-street; at
Bentley change on to a branch line, and in twenty minutes you are
there.&nbsp; If we are to believe the annalist Asser, its origin
is to be traced as far back as Alfred the Great&rsquo;s time, or
the latter half of the ninth century.&nbsp; Asser relates that
the Danish Chief Guthrum, after having been defeated by King
Alfred, embraced Christianity, was appointed governor of East
Anglia; that he divided, cultivated, and inhabited the district,
and that when he died he was buried in the royal town called
Headlega.&nbsp; Be that as it may, in the ancient church of
Hadleigh, according to popular belief, there still remains his
tomb.&nbsp; The principal event in connection with Hadleigh is
that there Dr. Taylor was burnt to death by the Roman
Catholics.&nbsp; The little town, says Fox, first heard of the
pure Gospel of Christ from the lips of the Rev. Thomas Bilney,
who preached there with great earnestness, and whose work was
greatly blessed, numbers of men and women becoming convinced of
the errors and idolatries of Popery, and gladly embracing the
Christian faith.&nbsp; After the martyrdom of Bilney, Dr. Rowland
Taylor was appointed vicar.&nbsp; He possessed the friendship of
Cranmer, and it was through him that he obtained his
living.&nbsp; In Queen Mary&rsquo;s time the Church was no place
for such as he.&nbsp; He <a name="page16"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 16</span>was hauled up before Gardiner, Bishop
of Winchester.&nbsp; The Bishop, with other bishops, sent him
back to Hadleigh to burn to death.&nbsp; &ldquo;On his way Dr.
Taylor was very joyful; he spoke many things to the sheriff and
yeomen of the guard that conducted him, and often moved them to
weep by his earnest calling upon them to repent and turn to the
true religion.&rdquo;&nbsp; At Hadleigh he was burnt, much to the
sorrow of his flock, who revered and loved him.&nbsp; A very
modest monument marks the site of the scene of the martyrdom and
the triumph, as it then seemed, of Popery and arbitrary
power.&nbsp; On the monument, which stands on a grass plot
guarded by rails, is an inscription to the memory of Dr. Taylor,
ending as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>Triumphant Saint, he braved and kissed the rod,<br
/>
And soared on seraph wing to meet his God.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The lines were the composition of Dr. Nathan Drake, a doctor
of medicine, much given to literature, and the author of many
books&mdash;now rarely seen and never read&mdash;who lived and
died at Hadleigh.&nbsp; In the church also, the great ornament to
the town is a memorial of Dr. Taylor, and in the vestry of the
Congregational chapel, just opposite the church, is a rude
engraving of the martyrdom, which ought to be reproduced.</p>
<p>Dissent does not fare badly in the town.&nbsp; The
Congregational body rejoices in two ministers, and the chapel, a
very handsome one, is well attended.&nbsp; It will seat a
thousand hearers.&nbsp; The Salvation Army have just commenced
preaching in the town, and, as usual, they have drawn some of the
people away.&nbsp; The Primitive Methodists and the Baptists have
also places of worship at Hadleigh.&nbsp; The parish church can
hold 1,200 people, but I do not hear that it is better attended
than the Congregational chapel.&nbsp; Congregationalism has a
long history in Hadleigh.&nbsp; One of its most successful
preachers was the Rev. Isaac Toms, who held his ministry there
for fifty-seven years.&nbsp; &ldquo;His memory,&rdquo; writes the
Rev. Hugh Pigot, formerly curate <a name="page17"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 17</span>of Hadleigh, &ldquo;is mentioned with
respect as that of a kind and gentlemanly old man, who, while
maintaining his own views, did yet regularly attend the week-day
services at the Church.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was born in London, 1710,
and his first engagement is said to have been with a city knight,
of Hackney, with whom be continued as chaplain and tutor till
1742.&nbsp; He refused, from conscientious scruples, to accept
preferment in the Established Church when offered him by his
patron.&nbsp; He is said to have been eminent for his attainments
as a scholar, and to have enjoyed the friendship of such men as
Dr. Doddridge and Dr. Watts.&nbsp; In the vestry there is
preserved a letter written by him to Washington&rsquo;s private
secretary during the American War.&nbsp; Dissent has grown in the
place since his day.&nbsp; In a return made to Bishop Secker by
Dr. Tanner, and preserved in the Rectory, there is to be found
the following:&mdash;About 100 Presbyterians of no note; Robert
Randall, a wool-comber, and his three children, and Birch,
shopkeeper, Anabaptist; no Anabaptist teacher, no Methodist, no
Moravian; one Presbyterian Meeting-house, one Presbyterian
teacher&mdash;viz., Isaac Toms; the said house and teacher
generally thought to be duly licensed and qualified according to
law.&nbsp; Their number not increased at all of late years.&nbsp;
The parish remarkably happy in regard to Dissenters, their number
very trifling in proportion to the whole number of inhabitants,
which, <span class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 1754, was computed in
the town, 2,092; in the hamlet, 168&mdash;2,260.&nbsp; As we have
seen, Popery had done to death vicar and curate, yet in 1754 we
find Dr. Tanner thus writes concerning it: &ldquo;Eight poor
Papists&mdash;James Nowland (a taylor) and his daughter, Widow
Rand and her daughter, Widow Hoggar, the wife of Ralph Adams, a
sadler, and Barry, a taylor, all quiet people.&nbsp; No person
lately perverted to Popery; no Popish place of worship; no Popish
priest doth reside in or resort to this parish; no Popish school;
no confirmation or visitation hath been lately held by a Popish
bishop.&rdquo;&nbsp; <a name="page18"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 18</span>Queen Mary, and Bonner, and Gardiner,
had all laboured in vain.&nbsp; Compulsory establishment of
religion never succeeds in the long run.</p>
<p>In the churchyard of Hadleigh there are no monuments which
require description.&nbsp; There is, however a curious
inscription on a headstone on the south-east side leading to the
market-place regarding the name and fame of one John Turner, a
blacksmith, who died 1715.</p>
<blockquote><p>My sledge and hammer lie declined,<br />
My bellows have quite lost their wind;<br />
My fire&rsquo;s extinct, my forge decayed,<br />
My vice is in the dust all laid;<br />
My coal is spent, my iron gone,<br />
My nails are drove, my work is done;<br />
My fire-dried corpse lies here at rest,<br />
My soul smoke-like is soaring to be blest.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hadleigh has seen better days.&nbsp; At one time it flourished
by reason of its cloth trade; then it took to making silk, and up
to recent times it did a great trade in malt.</p>
<p>I would not live in Hadleigh all my life, but it is certainly
a quiet corner into which to creep, and houses are to be had a
bargain, considering, after all, how near it is to town.&nbsp; I
can&rsquo;t find that Hadleigh has given birth to any great
men.&nbsp; It may be that they may come in time.&nbsp; One
distinguished personage born there, Bishop Overall, was one of
the translators of the Bible, and wrote that part of the Church
Catechism which treats of the Sacraments.&nbsp; Another, William
Alabaster, wrote a play called <i>Roxana</i>, which was so
pathetic when acted at Trinity College, Cambridge, that it drove
a young woman quite out of her wits.&nbsp; No wonder our Puritan
forefathers had a horror of the stage.</p>
<p>One of the most eminent men born in Hadleigh, was Dr. Reeve,
whose monument is in the Octagon chapel, Norwich, written by the
earliest of English German scholars.&nbsp; William Taylor still
records his worth and fame, a student at the University of
Edinburgh, he became intimate with Francis Horner, and helped to
<a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>write in
the early numbers of the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>.&nbsp; In 1802,
he was elected a member of the far famed Speculative
Society.&nbsp; In London, where he went to continue his
professional studies, he frequently met Coleridge, and the elder
Disraeli at dinner.&nbsp; In the spring of 1805, while travelling
on the continent&mdash;a place then rarely visited by the
English, he saw Napoleon on the morrow of Austerlitz&mdash;was
introduced to Haydn&mdash;was present when Beethoven conducted
Fidelio&mdash;heard Humboldt relate his travels&mdash;and Fichte
explain his philosophy.&nbsp; Thus, as life opened around with
him, with the most brilliant prospects, he died at his
father&rsquo;s house Hadleigh, in September, 1814.&nbsp; It was
his son, who for a while was the editor of the
<i>Edinburgh</i>.</p>
<p>In modern history, Hadleigh may claim to have made its
mark.&nbsp; It was there that the Oxford movement commenced, when
in 1833 the Rev. James Rose, the rector, assembled at the
parsonage (the present handsome building evidently has been built
since then) the men who were to become famous as
Tractarians.&nbsp; They had met there to consider how to save the
Church.&nbsp; Lord Grey had bidden the Bishops to put their
houses in order&mdash;ten Irish Bishoprics had been
suppressed&mdash;a mob at Bristol had burnt the Bishop&rsquo;s
palace.&nbsp; The Church seemed powerless and effete.&nbsp; The
friends who met at the Hadleigh Rectory resolved to commence the
Oxford Tracts.&nbsp; Mr. Rose was the person of most
authority.&nbsp; As Dean Church writes: &ldquo;As far as could be
seen at the time, he was the most accomplished divine and teacher
in the English Church.&nbsp; He was a really learned man.&nbsp;
He had intellect and energy, and literary skill to use his
learning.&nbsp; He was a man of singularly elevated and religious
character; he had something of the eye and temper of a
statesman.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The Oxford movement owed to
him,&rdquo; again writes Dean Church, &ldquo;not only its first
impulse, but all that was best and most hopeful in it, and when
it lost him it lost its wisest and ablest guide and
inspirer.&rdquo;&nbsp; He and Mr. Palmer, and Mr. A. Perceval,
formed, as it were, the right <a name="page20"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 20</span>wing of the little council.&nbsp;
Their Oxford allies were Mr. Froude, Mr. Keble, and Mr.
Newman.&nbsp; From this meeting resulted the <i>Tracts for the
Times</i>, and the agitation connected with them.&nbsp; Now that
the tumult of the strife is over, it is evident that they gave
new life to the Church; that they saved it&mdash;for a time.</p>
<p>The world of art also is indebted to Hadleigh.&nbsp; It was
the birthplace of Thomas Woolner, the great sculptor.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There is&rdquo; wrote a critic in <i>The Century</i>,
&ldquo;no living artist, whose work a man of letters approaches
with more instructive interest than that of Mr. Woolner, himself,
almost as eminent as a poet as a sculptor.&nbsp; His place in
literature as the author of <i>My Beautiful Lady</i>, and
<i>Pygmalion</i>, has long been decided, and needs no
re-illustration.&nbsp; But after all the profession of Mr.
Woolner&rsquo;s life has been sculpture.&nbsp; Thomas Woolner,
was born at Hadleigh, on the 17th December, 1825.&nbsp; At the
age of thirteen he began life as the pupil of Mr. Behmes,
sculptor in ordinary to the Queen.&nbsp; There may be persons
living at Hadleigh, who remember the boy sculptor, and who could
possibly give interesting facts respecting his early
proclivities.&rdquo;&nbsp; Alas, Hadleigh seems to have preserved
no memory of him whatever.&nbsp; A lady resident in the town
writes me, &ldquo;I have heard that my grandfather, of Shelley
Hall, once lent money to Thomas Woolner&rsquo;s father.&nbsp; I
have asked several of the inhabitants if they remember Thomas
Woolner, but I have not been successful in getting information at
present.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>IV.<br
/>
A GRAND MEDI&AElig;VAL TOWN.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">On</span> one of the hottest of our summer
days I chanced to fall into conversation with an elderly decayed
tradesman, living in a house erected for such as he.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Are you comfortable?&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; was the reply, &ldquo;we do our best to
make ourselves as comfortable as we can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was struck with the good sense of his answer.&nbsp; Ah,
thought I, as we parted, how much happier we would all be if we
did as the decayed tradesman did.&nbsp; The conversation took
place opposite the grand Abbey-gate of the ancient town of Bury
St. Edmunds.&nbsp; No Englishman should wander off to the
Continent until he has first visited Bury St. Edmunds, a town
full of busy life, peopled with more than 16,000 inhabitants,
which rejoices in a rich historic past, and which, especially if
you are there on a market-day, strikes the stranger as a place of
immense activity and bustle.&nbsp; It is eighty-three miles from
Liverpool-street, and you can see all its lions&mdash;and they
are very numerous&mdash;in a day.&nbsp; On the eastern ridge of
it&mdash;as Carlyle wrote in <i>Past and Present</i>&mdash;still
runs, long, black, and massive, a range of monastic ruins.&nbsp;
Its chief claim to fame is that it was the burial place of the
young Saxon king known as Edmund, who, in 870, was cruelly
murdered by the Danes at Hoxne, not far off.&nbsp; After the
lapse of many years, the body was brought <a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>to Bury,
where it was placed in the renowned Abbey, which owes much of its
greatness to Edward the Confessor, and which for more than six
hundred years remained one of the chief ecclesiastical centres of
medi&aelig;val England.&nbsp; Piety, wealth, and superstition did
much for the place.&nbsp; Its churchyard is one of the most
picturesque in all the land.&nbsp; Its churches are marvels of
beauty, and one of them contains the tomb of Mary Tudor, Queen of
France, and third daughter of Henry VII. of England.&nbsp; Bury
is famous as being the spot where the Barons met before enforcing
the signature of Magna Charta by King John, who, on his return
from France in 1214, met the nobles at Bury, and confirmed on
oath a charter restoring the laws enacted by Edward the
Confessor, and abolishing the arbitrary Norman code.&nbsp; You
have to pay sixpence to visit the Abbey grounds, which are left
in good order, and which ought to be thrown open to the public;
but many people will not grudge the money when they come to the
spot where is an inscription denoting that Cardinal Langton and
the Barons swore at the altar that they would obtain from King
John the satisfaction of Magna Charta, and another, close by,
giving the names and titles of the twenty-five Barons who thus
met.&nbsp; A few yards off are the ruins of the refectory where
was held the Parliament which decided on the impeachment of
Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester.&nbsp; Many Parliaments were held at
Bury; many kings and queens and mighty personages came
there.&nbsp; It had its martyrs&mdash;like Coping, who was hanged
for not believing the Prayer-book, and Lawes, an innocent
clergyman, who, with forty others, was condemned and executed for
witchcraft.&nbsp; The Jews, also, were very badly treated when,
as usual, they were charged with the murder of a Christian
child.&nbsp; The house where the chief Jew lived is still to be
seen near the Market Place.&nbsp; It is now utilised by the
police, who will shortly be removed to a finer building which is
being erected in the neighbourhood.</p>
<p>According to Carlyle, Bury St. Edmunds &ldquo;is still a
prosperous, rising town; beautifully diversifying with <a
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>its clean
brick houses, ancient clean streets, the general grassy face of
Suffolk looking out right pleasantly from its hill-slope towards
the rising sun.&rdquo;&nbsp; The earliest reliable records tell
of its foundation about 631 by Siegbert, King of the East
Anglians.&nbsp; Many of the monks of the Abbey did good service
to literature,&mdash;such as John Lydgate, who conducted a school
of rhetoric there.&nbsp; In its Grammar School many distinguished
men were educated,&mdash;such as Archbishop Sancroft, John Gauden
(Bishop of Worcester), John Warren (Bishop of Bangor), Thomas
Thurlow (Bishop of Durham), Tomline (Bishop of Winchester),
Blomfield (Bishop of London), Lord Cranworth, Lord Keeper
Guildford, Sir Thomas Hanmer (Speaker of the House of Commons and
the first editor of Shakespeare), Baron Alderson, and Chief Baron
Reynolds.&nbsp; One of its masters, the late Dr. Donaldson, was
referred to on one occasion as one of the most learned men in
Europe.&nbsp; There are many scholastic establishments in the
town.&nbsp; One of the most successful in our time is the East
Anglian School, founded by the Wesleyans, and carried on by them
in a handsome block of buildings occupying a commanding site.</p>
<p>As was to be expected, the town is Churchy, and its politics
are Conservative.&nbsp; The Salvationists, I am told, are doing
well, and I have boyish memories of a fat man of the name of
Elven, who was rather a leading man among the Suffolk Baptists;
but what I was chiefly impressed with was his size.&nbsp; The
family of the late Crabbe Robinson, one of the first of
&ldquo;our foreign correspondents,&rdquo; was long distinguished
in Bury St. Edmunds.&nbsp; One of his brothers was Mayor several
times.&nbsp; They were all connected with the Presbyterian church
in the place; one of Lady Howley&rsquo;s, kept alive by a scanty
endowment&mdash;not much matter as things are.&nbsp; The present
worthy minister is a vegetarian, and has a large garden in which
he grows his vegetables.&nbsp; If he is succeeded by a
flesh-eating parson, I fear at the present price of
butcher&rsquo;s meat the latter will have rather a hard time of
it.&nbsp; It is interesting to note <a name="page24"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 24</span>that the celebrated Ouida was born in
Bury St. Edmunds, and that Robertson, of Brighton, commenced his
career here as an articled clerk to a local solicitor.</p>
<p>Blomfield, grandfather of the Bishop of London, kept a school
here, and Crabbe Robinson was one of his pupils.&nbsp; The
preacher at that time at the Independent chapel was Mr.
Waldegrave.&nbsp; Crabbe Robinson describes him as &ldquo;an
ignorant, noisy, ranting preacher; he bawled loud, thumped the
cushion, and sometimes cried; he was, however, a kind man, and of
course he was a favourite of mine.&rdquo;&nbsp; As an
illustration of the state of religion among the Independents a
hundred years ago, it is curious to notice Robinson&rsquo;s
mother&rsquo;s experience, which he quotes.&nbsp; &ldquo;There
was no allusion to the Trinity,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;in it,
or any other disputed doctrine.&nbsp; Indeed, the word belief
scarcely occurs.&nbsp; The one sentiment which runs throughout is
a consciousness of personal unworthiness, with which are combined
a desire to be united to the Church, and a reliance on the merits
of Christ.&rdquo;&nbsp; One of the great men who lived later on
at Bury was Capel Lofft, a gentleman of good family, an author
also on an infinity of subjects.&nbsp; Capel Lofft is chiefly
remembered now as the earliest patron of the poet
Blomfield.&nbsp; He was acting as Magistrate at Bury, and was a
leader among the Liberals of the place.&nbsp; Another
distinguished East Anglian, who lived near Bury at that time was
the celebrated agricultural writer, Arthur Young.&nbsp; It was to
Bury Madame de Genlis fled for safety on the outbreak of the
French Revolution.&nbsp; The celebrated Pamela escaped with
her.&nbsp; Another French refugee who found temporary shelter at
Bury was the Duke de Liancourt.&nbsp; It was he who brought the
news of the capture of the Bastille to the unfortunate Louis, who
exclaimed, &ldquo;Why, that is a revolt.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; answered Liancourt, &ldquo;it is not a
revolt&mdash;it is a revolution.&rdquo;&nbsp; A Miss Bude, of
Bury, who afterwards became the wife of Clarkson, the
philanthropist, Mr. Robinson mentions as &ldquo;the most eloquent
woman I have ever known, with the exception of Madame de
Sta&euml;l.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was at Bury that Robinson, who had
been called to the <a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span>bar, made his <i>debut</i>.&nbsp; At his first dinner
with the barristers at the Angel Inn, among the company was Hart,
one of the most remarkable men of the circuit.&nbsp; He was
originally a preacher among the Calvinistic Methodists.&nbsp; It
was said to him once, &ldquo;Mr. Hart, when I hear you in the
pulpit I wish you were never out of it; when I see you out of it,
I wish you were never in it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Bury Gaol had acquired
some celebrity for the superior way in which its criminal
population were looked after.</p>
<p>Bury St. Edmunds may claim to have given shelter to the
immortal Daniel Defoe.&nbsp; He had been in the pillory before
the Royal Exchange, in London, near the Conduit at Cheapside, and
the third day at Temple Bar.&nbsp; He was the hero of the people,
who garlanded him with flowers, repeating as they did so, with
special gusto, the lines:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Tell them the men that placed him here<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Are scandals to the times,<br />
Are at a loss to find his guilt,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And can&rsquo;t commit his crimes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But his imprisonment ruined him financially, his brick works
at Tilbury failing through his absence.&nbsp; On the intercession
of Harley, he was released early in August, 1704, and at once
retired to Bury St. Edmunds to avoid the public gaze, and to
recruit his health.&nbsp; He was not idle there, for he issued
pamphlets within a month, besides his reviews.&nbsp; The chapel
where he attended yet remains.&nbsp; The old Presbyterian Chapel
in Churchgate Street must have been erected when he was
there.&nbsp; It is a fine old-fashioned red-brick building, where
Rev. Mr. Kennard at present preaches to a rather scanty
congregation.</p>
<p>But the modern inhabitants of Bury do not come up to the high
literary standard of their predecessors, such as Richard
D&rsquo;Aunger Vyle, tutor to Edward III.; Jocelin of Brakeland,
whose chronicle of the monastery is referred to as vividly
personifying the religious life of the middle ages; and John
Lydgate, who took charge of the School of Rhetoric in the town,
and wrote numerous poems, such as the <i>Storie of Thebes</i>,
<i>The </i><a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span><i>Troy Book</i>, and <i>London Lickpenny</i>, one of
our earliest satires.&nbsp; Nor must we forget Richard Byfield,
one of Tyndal&rsquo;s friends, who was formerly Chamberlain for
the Monastery.&nbsp; Richard de Bury, Chancellor to Edward III.,
and author of the <i>Philobiblion</i>, deserves honourable
mention here as a native of the town.&nbsp; Fielding, in his
<i>Amelia</i>, sends one of his characters to Bury for recovery
of health, and describes it as a gay and busy town.&nbsp; Mrs.
Inchbald, whose history reads like a romance, was born in a small
farm-house at Standingfield, close by Bury St. Edmunds.&nbsp; The
mother, Mrs. Simpson, had a strong taste for the theatre, and her
family loved acting quite as much as she did.&nbsp; They all
diligently attended the Bury Theatre&mdash;even the
rehearsals.&nbsp; The actors and actresses were looked up to,
almost worshipped, and when the theatre was closed the chief
amusement of the family consisted in reading aloud the scenes
which had been enjoyed so heartily.&nbsp; The unmarried son left
the farm for the stage, and Elizabeth longed to do the
same.&nbsp; Before reaching the age of thirteen, she frequently
declared that she would rather die than live any longer without
seeing the world.&nbsp; When a few years older, and ripe in
maiden charms, she made her way to London, married an actor, and
became an actress; wrote her simple story which yet finds
readers, and died in the sixty-eighth year of her age, after she
had burnt her memoirs, which would have been well worth reading,
and for which she had been offered a thousand guineas.&nbsp;
Another well-known name connected with Bury was that of Calamy,
the elder, a rigid Presbyterian, who, about 1630, was one of the
town lecturers at Bury.&nbsp; Subsequently he became Rector of
Aldersmanbury, London, and one of the Assembly of Divines, and
frequently preached before Parliament.&nbsp; He lived to see
London in ashes, the sight of which broke his heart.&nbsp; His
son Edmund was born at Bury, became a distinguished preacher, was
ejected, and formed a congregation in Currier&rsquo;s Hall, near
Cripplegate, London.&nbsp; His son, who was likewise a leading
London <a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
27</span>preacher, was the editor of the Abridgement of Mr.
Baxter&rsquo;s <i>History of His Life and Times</i>, and left
behind him <i>An Historical Account of My Own Life</i>, a
valuable contribution to the annals of his times published in
1829.</p>
<p>There is an anecdote of Rowland Hill, the eccentric preacher,
in connection with Bury, too good to be omitted.&nbsp; He had
come to preach at the Congregational Chapel, and, there being no
railway then, had travelled in his own carriage, and with his own
horses.&nbsp; Very properly he was anxious about the
accommodation provided for the latter.&nbsp; The minister, Mr.
Dewhirst, told him that he need be under no apprehension on that
score, as he had a horse-dealer, a member of his church, who
would look after them.&nbsp; &ldquo;What!&rdquo; said Rowland
Hill, in astonishment, &ldquo;a horse-dealer a member of a
Christian Church! who ever heard of such a thing?&rdquo;&nbsp;
Evidently at that time horse-dealers had a somewhat doubtful
reputation.&nbsp; Is it not delightful to think how much honester
they are now?</p>
<p>Politically Bury St. Edmunds is extinct.&nbsp; It returned two
members since 1292.&nbsp; Formerly the constituency consisted
only of the Corporation.&nbsp; In 1832 it was enlarged so as to
embrace the resident Freemen and the ten-pound householders, and
it was the custom for the Duke of Grafton and the Marquis of
Bristol each to return a member.&nbsp; Field-Marshal Conway, the
friend of Horace Walpole, was the most distinguished man Bury St.
Edmunds ever returned to Parliament.&nbsp; It is an anomaly that
gives Bury the right to return the one member left it by recent
legislation.&nbsp; But we rejoice in anomalies.&nbsp; For
instance, look at Ireland.&nbsp; Ireland is inferior to the great
metropolis, either in regard to population or property, but
Ireland rejoices in nearly double the number of legislators it
sends to the Imperial Parliament.</p>

IPSWICH: THE PRIDE OF THE ORWELL.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Lying</span> in a valley surrounded by
hills, up which the town is gradually climbing, and watered by
the picturesque Orwell, which elevates the town to the dignity of
a port, and within little more than an hour and a half&rsquo;s
run from London by the Great Eastern Railway, Ipswich may claim
to be a place well worth visiting, while to the trader it is
known and appreciated as a busy and thriving town.&nbsp; When I
first knew it&mdash;at a time a little antecedent to the advent
of the illustrious Mr. Pickwick&mdash;it was not much of a place
to look at.&nbsp; With the exception of the space opposite the
Town Hall, a handsome building all of the modern time, the people
seemed sadly hampered for want of room.&nbsp; In this respect the
place has been wonderfully improved of late, as much as any town
in Her Majesty&rsquo;s dominions; not even Birmingham more.&nbsp;
It was one of the first places to have an Arboretum, which is
well kept up for the health and comfort of its people.&nbsp; Then
by the river a pleasant promenade has been formed, where, when
the tide comes up from Harwich, bringing with it a faint touch of
the briny, you may fancy that you are by the side of the sea
itself.&nbsp; That River Orwell is a sight in itself, and is
utilised by the young and vigorous as regards boating and bathing
in a way conducive to the development of health and muscle
alike.&nbsp; The corn market at Ipswich is one of the most
important in the kingdom, and the public buildings are numerous,
and <a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>boast
not a little of architectural skill, as, for instance, the
Grammar School, the theatre, Tacket Street Chapel&mdash;one of
the oldest representatives of Nonconformity in the
place&mdash;the pile of buildings forming the offices of <i>The
East Anglian Daily Times</i>&mdash;the most successful of the
East Anglian dailies, which would be a credit even to the
metropolis.&nbsp; One of the handsomest piles of buildings in the
town is that occupied by the Museum, the Schools of Art and
Science, and the Victorin Free Library.&nbsp; Since their
completion in 1881, the whole of the valuable books and
arch&aelig;logical treasures belonging to the Corporation have
been classified and attractively arranged for inspection by
visitors.&nbsp; The old Judge&rsquo;s chambers have now been
turned into a club, which supplies a want felt in such a
place.&nbsp; I think Ipswich was one of the first towns to start
a Mechanics&rsquo; Institute, still in vigorous existence; while
all over Europe you may meet with agricultural machines that had
their birth in the great works of Ransomes, Sims, and
Jefferies&mdash;names dear to the farmer all the land over.&nbsp;
Ipswich is now also becoming celebrated for its boots and shoes,
while its tasteful shops indicate a considerable amount of
intelligence and wealth as existing among its people to the
present day.</p>
<p>Ipswich contains no less than thirteen churches, built, for
the most part, in the Perpendicular style of architecture.&nbsp;
Portions of some, however, are of earlier date.&nbsp; The oak
door at St. Mary at the Elms, for instance, is in the Norman
style, but slightly enriched, and therefore probably of the older
or primary Norman.&nbsp; The Town Hall stands upon the Cornhill,
upon the site of St. Mildred&rsquo;s Church, many centuries
disused.&nbsp; There also stood an ancient Hall of Pleas; and a
Sociary or Seating Room of the Corpus Christi Guilds was erected
there in Henry VIII.&rsquo;s time.&nbsp; The mansions of Ipswich
merchants in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, still to be
found ornamenting the parish of St. Clement&rsquo;s, are worthy
of close inspection, as they attest the wealth and importance of
those who once inhabited them.&nbsp; Very many of the houses bear
dates, and have fine <a name="page30"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 30</span>ornamental exteriors.&nbsp; Many of
the fine carved corner posts of the fifteenth and sixteenth
centuries still remain.&nbsp; A gateway, an interesting relic of
the great Cardinal Wolsey, who was a native of Ipswich, stands
abutting upon College Street, and near the East end of St.
Peter&rsquo;s Church.&nbsp; It is of brick and small, and was
probably not the chief place of egress attached to the building,
which was undoubtedly built in a style of magnificence, and in
accordance with the fine taste in architecture which the Cardinal
was known to have possessed.&nbsp; Over the doorway are the arms
of Henry VIII., and on each side of the Royal coat is a
trefoil-headed niche, though now containing no figures.&nbsp; The
place was erected in 1528.&nbsp; In the early part of the present
century Ipswich was evidently a declining town.&nbsp; In 1813 its
population was only 13,670, when Windham, the great statesman,
who visited the place, speaks of it in very favourable terms as a
town, picturesque and pleasant.&nbsp; At this present time the
town has a population of 57,260.&nbsp; One of the most eminent
men born in Ipswich was Firmin, the London draper, who was a
philanthropist of the noblest character, and who did much for the
poor both at Ipswich and in London.&nbsp; He was a Unitarian when
to be anything but orthodox was considered in all circles as a
matter of serious censure, and yet he was a friend of a Liberal
Bishop.&nbsp; He is buried in Christ Church, Newgate Street,
close to the great school for which he did so much, and to the
funds of which he was such a liberal contributor.&nbsp; In every
way he is to be considered a credit to his native town, and as
one of the foremost men of the age in which he lived, and which
he so greatly adorned.&nbsp; He set a good example that many of
our merchant princes have not been slow to imitate.&nbsp; Had he
been orthodox his fame would have been greater still.</p>
<p>One of the oldest houses in Ipswich is that known as Christ
Church, the dwelling place of the Fonnereaus for many
generations.&nbsp; It is one of the oldest houses in England, and
has been inhabited for 350 years.&nbsp; There is not a better
example of Elizabethan building to be <a name="page31"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 31</span>met with anywhere.&nbsp; More than
once has Royalty been hospitably entertained there.&nbsp; The
most celebrated Royal visitor was Queen Elizabeth, who made a
tour of the Eastern Counties in 1589, and rode through Essex and
Suffolk with a crowd of attendant cavaliers.&nbsp; Her Majesty
reached Ipswich in August, and was entertained there four
days.&nbsp; Local tradition says that the bed Her Majesty slept
in may be seen to this day in the haunted chamber of the old
mansion.&nbsp; Long before the house was built, there was on the
spot the convent and priory of Christ Church, tenanted by monks,
known as Black Canons of St. Augustine, who took an active part
in the business of the town, and to whom King John granted a
charter for a market, which became a very popular one.&nbsp; As
regards the park, the legend is that the bowling-green on the
summit, now surrounded by a double avenue of magnificent limes,
was one of those places selected by the Druids for purposes of
worship.&nbsp; It is certain that the Danes, who were much given
to sailing up and down the Orwell, on plunder bent, chose this
very spot as the site of what may be called a hall of
justice.&nbsp; There is reason to believe that on this very green
Charles II. played bowls.&nbsp; There was a celebrated Lord
Rochester who visited the house, and found the park-keeper
driving two donkeys for the purpose of keeping the turf in good
order.&nbsp; Further tradition says that in order not to hurt the
turf the donkeys wore boots, which induced the facetious Earl to
observe that Ipswich was &ldquo;a town without people, that there
was a river without water, and that asses wore
boots.&rdquo;&nbsp; Christ Church is now on sale.&nbsp;
Ultimately it is to be hoped it will be purchased by the
Corporation for a people&rsquo;s palace and park.</p>
<p>In the old times Ipswich must have been a much more
picturesque place than it is to-day.&nbsp; All its old records
are religiously preserved by a worthy townsman, Mr. John Glyde,
in his <i>Illustrations of Old Ipswich</i>, a handsome work,
which is a credit to the town, and which ought to find a place in
the library of East Anglians wealthy enough to purchase it.&nbsp;
He <a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>writes
lovingly of its gates and walls indicating the lamentable state
of insecurity by which our forefathers were embarrassed in those
good old times, when the Curfew Bell tolled every evening at
eight o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is, perhaps,&rdquo; says
an antiquarian writer, &ldquo;no house in the kingdom which, for
its size, is more curiously or quaintly ornamented than the
ancient house still standing in the Butter Market.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The tradition is that Charles II. was hidden for awhile in that
house after his defeat at Worcester.&nbsp; Be that as it may, the
Ipswich traders, like John Gilpin, were men of credit and renown,
and Fuller, in the seventeenth century, spoke of the number of
wealthy merchant houses in Ipswich.&nbsp; It was in the reign of
Elizabeth, remarks Mr. Glyde, that Ipswich seems to have attained
the zenith of its fame.&nbsp; There is scarcely a branch of
foreign commerce carried on at the present time, with the
exception of trade with China, that was not prosecuted with more
or less entirety in the reign of Queen Elizabeth.&nbsp; At that
time Ipswich was much richer in shipping than Yarmouth,
Southampton, or Lynn.&nbsp; Foreign weavers discovered the
advantage of using English wool, and the gold of Flanders found
its way into the pockets of English traders.&nbsp; The town still
boasts a memorial of Cardinal Wolsey&rsquo;s munificent
liberality.&nbsp; One of its representatives was no less a
distinguished person than Bacon&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">The wisest, greatest,
meanest of mankind.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cavendish, the explorer of the world, was one of the
personages at one time often to be seen in its
streets&mdash;streets along which had ridden in triumph Queens
Mary and Elizabeth, to say nothing of the Saxon Queen, who at one
time resided in the town.&nbsp; But if Ipswich knows no longer
the grandeur and pageantry of the past, if its Black Friars are
vanished, it is still the abiding place of that new and better
spirit to which Cromwell appealed, and not in vain, when he
sought to make this England of ours great and free.</p>
<p><a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
33</span>&ldquo;I knew of no town to be compared to
Ipswich,&rdquo; wrote old Cobbett, &ldquo;except it be
Nottingham, and there is this difference that Nottingham stands
high and on one side looks over a fine country whereas Ipswich is
in a dell, meadows running up above it and a beautiful arm of the
sea below it.&nbsp; From the town itself you can see nothing, but
you can in no direction go from it a charter of a mile without
finding views that a painter might crave, and then the country
round is so well cultivated.&rdquo;&nbsp; A good deal has been
done for Ipswich since Cobbett&rsquo;s day.&nbsp; It has its
public promenades and in the neighbourhood of the river there
still lingers somewhat of the scenery Gainsborough loved to
paint.&nbsp; There is also a good deal of literary association
connected with Ipswich.&nbsp; The White Horse Inn still remains
in much the same state as it was in the times of Mr. Pickwick,
&ldquo;famous,&rdquo; wrote Dickens, &ldquo;in the neighbourhood,
in the same degree as a prize ox, or county paper chronicled
turnip or unwieldy pig for its enormous size.&rdquo;&nbsp; Any
one who has sojourned there will find it easy to understand how
the illustrious Pickwick came to mistake a lady&rsquo;s
bed-chamber for his own.&nbsp; Why should not the Great White
Horse be as dear to the admirers of Dickens as the Leather Bottle
at Cobham?&nbsp; If the admirers of Pickwick rush as they do by
hundreds to Cobham to view the room where Pickwick slept, why, it
may be asked, should not a similar patronage be extended to the
Great White Horse at Ipswich.</p>
<p>Curious people besides Pickwick and his friends have favoured
Ipswich.&nbsp; There lived there in the reign of William III., a
family known as the &ldquo;odd family,&rdquo; a most appropriate
name, as the following facts clearly prove.&nbsp; Every event,
good, bad, or indifferent, came to that family in an odd year, or
on an odd day of the month, and every member of it was odd in
person, manner, or behaviour.&nbsp; Even the letters of their
christian names always amounted to an odd number.&nbsp; The
father and mother were Peter and Rahab; their seven <a
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>children (all
boys) bore the names of Solomon, Roger, James, Matthew, Jonas,
David, and Ezekiel.&nbsp; The husband possessed only one leg, and
his wife only one arm; Solomon was blind in his left eye, and
Roger lost his right optic by an accident.&nbsp; James had his
left ear pulled off in a quarrel; Matthew&rsquo;s left hand had
but three fingers; Jonas had a stump foot; David was humpbacked;
and Ezekiel was 6ft. 2in at the age of 19.&nbsp; Every one of the
children had red hair, notwithstanding the fact that the
father&rsquo;s hair was jet black and the mother&rsquo;s
white.&nbsp; Strange at birth all died as strange.&nbsp; The
father fell into a deep sawpit and was killed; the wife died five
years after of starvation.&nbsp; Ezekiel enlisted, was afterwards
wounded in 23 places, but recovered.&nbsp; Roger, James, Matthew,
Jonas, and David died in 1713, in different places on the same
day; Solomon and Ezekiel were drowned in the Thames in 1723.</p>
<p>Thomas Colson, known to Ipswich people as Robinson Crusoe,
died in the year 1811.&nbsp; He was originally a wool-comber,
then a weaver, but the failure of that employment induced him to
enter the Suffolk Militia, and while quartered in Leicester with
his Regiment, he learned the trade of stocking weaving, which he
afterwards followed in Suffolk.&nbsp; But this occupation he
shortly exchanged for that of fisherman on the Orwell.&nbsp; His
little craft, which he made himself, was a curiosity in its way,
and seemed too crazy to live in bad weather, and yet in it he
toiled day and night, in calm or storm.&nbsp; Subject to violent
chronic complaints, with a mind somewhat disordered, in person
tall and thin, with meagre countenance and piercing blue eyes, he
was thus described by a contemporary poet&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>With squalid garments round him flung,<br />
And o&rsquo;er his bending shoulders hung,<br />
A string of perforated stones,<br />
With knots of elm and horses bones.<br />
He dreams that wizards leagued with hell,<br />
Have o&rsquo;er him cast their deadly spell;<br />
Though pinching pains his limbs endure,<br />
He holds his life by charms secure,<br />
And, while he feels the torturing ban,<br />
No wave can drown the spell-bound man.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
35</span>&mdash;But this security was the means of his
death.&nbsp; In October, 1811, there was a great storm on the
Orwell, and he was driven in his boat on the mud.&nbsp; He
refused to leave his vessel, though advised and implored to do
so.&nbsp; The ebb of the tide drew his boat into deep water, and
he was drowned.</p>
<p>Amongst the charitable women of Ipswich must be mentioned Miss
Parish, a maiden lady, who died there in 1810.&nbsp; She seems to
have relieved everyone who was in distress.&nbsp; At the time of
her death she had actually twenty pensioners living in her house,
besides children supported at different schools, while numbers
were cheered by her occasional donations.&nbsp; She was a good
Samaritan indeed.&nbsp; It is to be hoped there are to be found
many such in the Ipswich of to-day.</p>

LIVING NORWICH.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">We</span> have heard a good deal of
Norwich.&nbsp; When the summer comes, some enterprising
journalist manages to find his way there, and if he has a copy of
Evelyn, waxes eloquent over its gardens, and market-place, and
ancient castle, and its memories of Sir Thomas Browne.&nbsp; I
write of the Norwich of to-day&mdash;of living Norwich&mdash;a
city with a population of more than a hundred thousand&mdash;that
has renewed its youth&mdash;that is marching on like John
Brown&rsquo;s soul; a Norwich that was, as I first remember it, a
seat of Parliamentary and political corruption, of vice and
ignorance, of apathy and sloth.&nbsp; It is a grand old city,
none grander anywhere in England.&nbsp; It is a place to me of
pleasant memories, and the stranger within its gates must admit
the charm of its grey towers and churches, its cathedral, its
well-wooded suburbs extending over a wide range of hills.&nbsp;
In that respect some claim for Norwich that it resembles
Jerusalem.&nbsp; From all I can make out I should be inclined to
give Norwich the preference.&nbsp; It has fewer Jews and not so
many fleas.</p>
<p>And first let me speak of living Norwich religiously.&nbsp;
One of our wise kings said that the spire of Harrow was an
outward and visible sign of the Church.&nbsp; Norwich rejoices in
many such signs.&nbsp; Perhaps one of <a name="page37"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 37</span>the most prominent at this time is
the new Roman Catholic Cathedral at the end of St. Giles&rsquo;s,
which has been nine years in building, which is being erected
regardless of expense, and which is far from completed yet.&nbsp;
I heard Cardinal Manning, who was the most complete
exemplification of the union of the wisdom of the serpent with
the harmlessness of the dove I ever saw, in one of his sermons
compare the Church of Rome to a lamb in the midst of
wolves.&nbsp; At Norwich, as in most parts of England, the lamb
is by no means a little one, and it may be in time it will
develop into a ram, and a ram can do not a little mischief.&nbsp;
What sign of life does the State Church give?&nbsp; Norwich is
full of parsons; are any of them men of note?&nbsp; It had one it
borrowed from dissent, Dr. Cunningham Geikie, but he could not
stand the climate, and now lives at Bournemouth.&nbsp; What sign
of life, again I ask, does the Norwich State Church
exhibit?&nbsp; Alas, the reply is not satisfactory.&nbsp; With
the exception of its new Dean, there is no clergyman of note
among them.&nbsp; Dean Lefroy is able, earnest, active, a worker
in many ways, social as well as religious, and on Sunday evening
fills the nave of the Cathedral, where he conducts a service
minus the Church prayers, and plus Moody and Sankey hymns.&nbsp;
He is Evangelical, and is making that influence felt.&nbsp; He is
an Irishman, and as a matter of coarse fervid and eloquent.&nbsp;
When he came to Norwich, I am told, he expressed his hope that he
should soon empty some of its many chapels.&nbsp; At present he
has not succeeded in the attempt.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think his
church understands the way to go to work aright in that
respect.&nbsp; When I was last in Norwich the Primitive
Methodists were in full conference.&nbsp; All the religious
bodies in Norwich gave them hearty greeting except the Church,
and the intolerance of its attitude naturally occasioned
considerable unfriendly comment.&nbsp; Wesleyan Methodism in
Norwich and throughout Norfolk is making great headway.&nbsp;
Still true to its old policy, which has been defined as a penny a
week, a shilling a quarter, and justification by faith, it has
gone in heartily <a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
38</span>for the Forward Movement, and the evidences are to be
met with everywhere.&nbsp; Congregationalism is also preparing to
commence a new cause in a hitherto neglected district, and it is
time it did, as it is nearly forty years since the new
Chapel-in-the-Field, now under the ministerial care of the Rev.
J. P. Perkins, started on its successful career.&nbsp; It already
has two prosperous mission stations as centres of religious
activity and life.&nbsp; It is needless to say that Princes
Street Chapel flourishes and prospers as it has ever done since
Rev. George Barrett&mdash;one of the most winning of men in the
Congregational ministry&mdash;has occupied its pulpit.&nbsp; The
establishment of the Pleasant Sunday Afternoons during the past
two years has been attended with great success and
blessing.&nbsp; The large congregations which crowd the Church
Sunday by Sunday prove that this class meets a need.&nbsp; It is
a pleasing feature of this work that it has called into active
service some members of the church who in the past had engaged in
no recognised form of Christian work.&nbsp; I was interested to
find that at the old aristocratic Unitarian Chapel, known as the
Octagon, they have Pleasant Sunday Afternoon Services and that
Rev. J. P. Perkins has conducted a service there.&nbsp; In
Norwich, as elsewhere, all the churches of all religious bodies
suffer more or less by the tendency of people successful in
business to live as much out of the city as possible.&nbsp;
Christian young men and women seem well looked after.&nbsp; The
Church young men have a good institution in a street leading into
Orford Hill, while the others meet in one of the old mansions in
St. Giles&rsquo;s Street.&nbsp; Education prospers in the old
city.&nbsp; I found a junior institute in connection with the
Church where the classes are well attended; and the Board School
educates 12,000 children, while the denominational schools
between them muster but 6,000.&nbsp; The School Board has
established one of a higher grade, which is a great success,
while the great Norwich publishers, Jarrold and Son, by their
publications have done much to supply the people with healthy and
popular literature.</p>
<p><a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>To
commercial Norwich I can devote but little space.&nbsp; The city
has flourished by reason of its being placed on two
rivers&mdash;the Wensum and the Yare.&nbsp; The Great Eastern
Railway gave it a tremendous lift, and, next to Mr. Colman, is
perhaps the largest employer of labour in the district.&nbsp; The
celebrated Carrow Works of Messrs. J. and J. Colman,
manufacturers of mustard, starch, corm-flour, and laundry-blue,
are known all the world over.&nbsp; Next in importance is the
manufactory of Norwich ales, as the county of Norfolk has long
been celebrated for its growth of the finest malting barley, and
Norwich is, unfortunately, overdone with public-houses.&nbsp; I
find that Messrs. Colman have established extensive Sunday and
week-day schools for the children of their workpeople, and employ
two Bible-women to visit them in their homes.&nbsp; I cannot find
that the Norwich brewers have distinguished themselves much in
this way, though it is to be feared that the need of such
agencies among their workpeople must be greater than it is
amongst those employed by Messrs. Colman.&nbsp; Norwich is a
great place for clothing and the manufacture of boots and
shoes.&nbsp; I suppose Harmer and Co. are at the head of the
great clothing factories.&nbsp; Their new factory in St.
Andrew&rsquo;s is an ornament to the city, and is perhaps one of
the finest in the world.&nbsp; It boasts a marvellous system of
ventilation introduced by an American company, which has never
before been tried in this country, and which every one interested
in such matters ought to study.&nbsp; Mr. Harmer, who in 1888 was
Mayor of Norwich, takes a deep interest in its welfare, and is
certainly a man whose opinions deserve consideration.&nbsp; He
thinks that the contemplated legislation, which has for its
ultimate object the doing away with outdoor work, will press very
hardly upon the working classes of the city, and will be more
injurious to them than their employers.&nbsp; The practice of the
firm has been to take into their employ young girls leaving
school, who soon acquire much dexterity in their work, and who,
when they marry, can be&mdash;and many of them are supplied with
sewing machines to use at home.&nbsp; <a name="page40"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 40</span>Be that as it may, he has done more
than any one in the great work of showing how a factory can be
rendered healthy, and is to be held in reverence as one of our
greatest practical sanitary reformers.&nbsp; One word more.&nbsp;
Norwich is the centre of a great agricultural district, and its
cattle market may be described as the largest of the kind in all
England.&nbsp; In one year alone as many as 95,000 beasts,
137,000 sheep, and 14,000 pigs were received for the
market.&nbsp; Till we all become vegetarians, Norwich will, by
reason of its cattle market alone, flourish as a living city
famed for its flesh pots, and beloved of John Bull.</p>
<p>Norwich has been a famous city ever since, at any rate, the
time when Sir Thomas Browne wrote his famed <i>Religio de
Medici</i> there.&nbsp; It was to the house of Mrs. Taylor, wife
of a Norwich tradesman, that Sir James Mackintosh and the other
leading Liberals of the day used to repair to hold high discourse
on the origin of society and the rights of man.&nbsp; Windham,
one of the greatest statesmen of his day, the friend of Johnson
and Burke, represented Norwich.&nbsp; There lived William Taylor,
the friend and correspondent of Southey, who was the first to
open up to the public the vast treasury of German thought.&nbsp;
Harriet Martineau was born there, as was likewise her more
celebrated brother James, who still lives to illustrate the
mental and religious speculation of our day.&nbsp; A grand old
city is Norwich, with its castle, now a museum, looking over it
all, with its St. Andrew&rsquo;s Hall, now utilised for concerts
and public meetings, with its great markets, with its
Colman&rsquo;s Mustard Mills, with its old houses and narrow
streets.&nbsp; The workman, with his strikes, has driven away
from Northampton a good deal of its boot and shoe
manufacture.&nbsp; What Northampton has lost Ipswich, Colchester,
and especially Norwich, have gained.&nbsp; There is beautiful
country round Norwich; and Norwich ought to be eminently holy,
for there are forty churches there, many of them very
ancient.&nbsp; We hear a good deal of the piety of our
forefathers.&nbsp; In Norwich we realise that fact as well as
anywhere.&nbsp; Norwich, <a name="page41"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 41</span>consequently, is the home of
bell-ringers.&nbsp; Mr. Suffling tells us, &ldquo;I suppose no
other place in England can boast of so many bell-ringers, or such
good ones, as Norwich.&rdquo;&nbsp; On certain occasions you are
deafened by the clamour of its bells.</p>
<p>Away from Ipswich, and Colchester, and Norwich there is a
delicious sleepiness about the old East Anglian towns, as if they
feel they have done their duty in their day and are out of the
world.&nbsp; They are all in a declining way.&nbsp; They have all
seen better days.&nbsp; They have not quite died out, because the
Great Eastern Railway has connected them all together and insists
on their sharing in the labours and triumphs of the present
day.&nbsp; But they had rather not.&nbsp; They would rather live
on their past glories&mdash;Bungay, with its renowned castle,
Framlingham with its castle still more renowned, Bury with its
memories of its martyr king, Woodbridge mildly illuminated by the
fame of Bernard Barton, the Quaker poet, Beccles with its fine
church, Halesworth where Archbishop Whateley was for many years
the rector.&nbsp; They are all places to live in happily if you
have had enough of excitement and would shun the wicked world and
its ways.</p>

A DAY AT LYNN.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">One</span> of the most curious corners of
old England is known, and has been known to the community for
many years, as King&rsquo;s Lynn, Norfolk, on the borders of the
Wash.&nbsp; It was a great place for traders.&nbsp; By means of
it in the olden time many a tun of good red wine came into the
country, and it is still a great place for trade, as it has fine
docks, available to steamers with a tonnage of 2,000 tons.&nbsp;
Thus Lynn is a great port for the landing of foreign sugar (which
ought to be made at home) from Hamburg.&nbsp; A hundred years ago
its annual shipping revenue was only exceeded by the ports of
London, Liverpool, Bristol and Hull.&nbsp; It is also easily
available by means of railway communication, which renders it
accessible from all quarters&mdash;the Great Northern, the
Midland, and the Great Eastern all find their way to Lynn.&nbsp;
The population has rather declined since the last census; but
still the town is a large one&mdash;upwards of 18,000 in
population&mdash;and one wonders how all the people hidden away
in its shops and narrow streets can manage to find a
living.&nbsp; The fact is, it is the centre of an enormous
agricultural district, and thus twice a week has a large extra
population, drawn thither by the attractions of its Saturday and
Tuesday markets.&nbsp; There seems to be no great manufacturing
industry, the chief being that of Mr. Savage, who employs about
three hundred people, all engaged in the manufacture of various
<a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>kinds of
roundabouts and steam velocipedes, such as are seen at our
country fairs.&nbsp; It is the most important business of the
kind in the Eastern Counties, and of it the people of the Town of
Lynn are justly proud.&nbsp; Nevertheless, to most of us the
charm of Lynn is chiefly antiquarian.&nbsp; Its wonderful old
churches are well worth visiting.&nbsp; In the good old times
Lynn was a fortified town, and there are still abundant remains
of the old walls, as well as a handsome Gothic structure, known
as the South-gate.&nbsp; Unfortunately the East-gate, an equally
fine specimen of ancient architecture, was demolished in the
first year of the present century.&nbsp; In the centre of one of
the public walks, well shaded by trees, which in summer cast a
grateful shade, stands an ancient chapel, known as the Red Mount,
a great resort for pilgrims.&nbsp; Stowe tells us it was in the
reign of King John that Lynn was fortified.&nbsp; The cup used by
the Mayor on the occasion of municipal festivities is said to
have been the gift of that monarch, as is likewise the sword
usually borne before the Mayor.&nbsp; In the Museum is preserved
one of the old ducking stools, which have gone out of fashion in
consequence of the increasing good temper of the ladies in these
latter days.&nbsp; There is an immense deal to see in Lynn.&nbsp;
I would gladly have tarried there longer, especially as I
obtained good quarters at the Temperance Hotel, which seemed to
be much patronised by commercial men.&nbsp; I found many of them
there after the day&rsquo;s work was over, reading one or other
of the good books provided for them by the Christian Commercial
Travellers&rsquo; Society, a society which does much good in many
ways.&nbsp; Lynn has a good hospital and a fine library.</p>
<p>Lynn has given birth to some notabilities, at any rate.&nbsp;
In 1752 Fanny Burney was born there, who wrote novels which still
find readers.&nbsp; The fair Fanny lived to be the friend of Dr.
Johnson and Mrs. Thrale, and, as Madame D&rsquo;Arblay, left us
diaries and letters which give us a vivid idea of life when
George III. was king.&nbsp; As is the case generally, nothing in
her childhood <a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
44</span>indicated that she would, while still a young woman have
secured for herself an honourable and permanent place among
English writers.&nbsp; Then there is the great African explorer
and artist, Thomas Baines, whose name, says a writer in <i>The
Cape Monthly Magazine</i>, must ever be associated with the
explorers of the country north of the Cape Colony, in the same
rank with Livingstone, Chapman, Anderson, and Green&mdash;a man
to whom the wilderness brought gladness and the mountains
peace.&nbsp; He was a native of that nursery of the Anglo-Saxon
race whose energy he so truly inherited&mdash;Norfolk.&nbsp; He
was born at Lynn in 1822.&nbsp; &ldquo;His father,&rdquo; writes
his biographer, &ldquo;also a man of considerable energy, was the
master of a small vessel belonging to that port, and no doubt his
marine life, as well as the striking scenery of the Norfolk
coast, gave a tinge to the early artistic tendencies of his
son.&rdquo;&nbsp; As was the case with our great painter of
cattle, it was while he was learning coach painting that he
became an artist.&nbsp; He landed at the Cape, where he managed
to obtain a scanty living by painting African landscape, and
teaching drawing.&nbsp; And then, when there was war with the
natives, he won reputation by painting the leading incidents of
the engagements.&nbsp; It is to the credit of Lynn that on his
return to his native town, in 1857, he was presented with the
Freedom of the Borough.&nbsp; Alas! his career as an explorer and
discoverer was cut short by African fever, and he now sleeps in
Durban Cathedral, where a monument records his memory.&nbsp;
Eugene Aram was an usher in the Lynn Grammar School; Sawtree, a
Wycliffe priest, burnt at Smithfield in 1400, came from Lynn; and
Bishop Goodwin, just deceased, was born at Lynn in 1818.&nbsp;
John Copegrave, a Provincial of the Austin Friars, and author of
the <i>Chronicle of England</i>, and Geoffry, a great grammarian,
and author of a Latin-English Dictionary, were natives of
Lynn.</p>
<p>Politically, Lynn has rather a celebrated history.&nbsp;
Formerly it was a close borough, belonging to the Walpole
family.&nbsp; The great Whig Minister represented <a
name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>it in
Parliament, as did also his equally celebrated son.&nbsp; Lord
George Bentinck, it may be remembered, sat for Lynn, also the
great diplomatist Sir Stratford Canning, known and feared in
Turkey.&nbsp; But Lynn has opened its eyes and burst its old
traditions.&nbsp; For the first time in its history it has a
Liberal majority on its Town Council; of course the Noncons. in
the place have had much to do with this.&nbsp; I find that no
less than six of the members of the Congregational church, under
the care of Rev. A. Furner, are members of the Corporation.&nbsp;
Congregationalism in such a city of churches and antiquity as
Lynn is, has not been much of a success.&nbsp; Baptists and
Independents were both at a low ebb, but they are reviving
greatly, and the night I was there I attended a meeting in the
mission-hall, where I found a clergyman and his Dissenting
brethren standing side by side.&nbsp; The Baptists, who are now
doing well since Rev. Thomas Perry has been amongst them, have an
interesting history.&nbsp; In 1687, Mr. Thomas Grantham, a
General Baptist Minister, well-known in Lincolnshire, and related
to some of the first families in that county, came to Lynn at the
period referred to, and obtained permission to preach in the
town-hall.&nbsp; He died at Norwich in 1692.&nbsp; In 1690, a
persecution broke out against the Baptists at Lynn, and James
Markam, their minister, was proceeded against under the
Conventicle Act, for attempting to establish &ldquo;a new
religion,&rdquo; on the deposition of two informers, and a fine
of &pound;20 was levied on the house in which they met, &pound;20
on the preacher, and 5s. on each hearer.&nbsp; In 1818, there
were many high Calvinists among the Lynn Baptists, and some of
the most devoted friends of the cause, believing such sentiments
to be an unfair view of the Gospel and injurious, withdrew, and
went to the Independent Chapel.&nbsp; In 1839, the veteran
preacher, Thomas Wigner, came to Lynn, little anticipating, he
tells us, that in the then state of his health he would be there
long, but he was there many years.&nbsp; Lynn has a Union chapel,
and it must be remembered, to its credit, that its pulpit was
occupied by Rev. William Hull, a very superior preacher indeed,
<a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>of whom
the late Dean Stanley declared that he was the Robertson of the
Nonconformist Church.</p>
<p>One of the most celebrated of Lynn residents was, perhaps, the
Rev. William Richards, M.D., who was for twenty years pastor of
the General Baptist Church in that town.&nbsp; He commenced his
career in Wales, not many miles from Haverford West.&nbsp; In
1773, at the age of 24, he entered the Bristol
&ldquo;Academy.&rdquo;&nbsp; Two years later he became co-pastor
at Pershore, with the late Dr. John Ash, author of the English
Dictionary.&nbsp; Perhaps it was through contact with Dr. Ash
that he first conceived the idea of writing his very popular
Welsh-English Dictionary.&nbsp; In 1776, he settled at Lynn, and
during his residence there wrote, besides many other works, a
&ldquo;History of Lynn&rdquo; in two octavo volumes, printed in
1812, at Lynn, by W. G. Whittingham.&nbsp; He willed his library
to the Brown University, Rhode Island, from which university he
received his doctor&rsquo;s degree.&nbsp; He died in 1818, in
Wales, where for supposed unsoundness in the faith&mdash;a
groundless charge, however&mdash;he suffered a good deal.&nbsp;
Dr. Richards was a man of exemplary life, of much learning and of
downright independence of judgment, and from all I can learn of
him he deserved to be remembered at Lynn and throughout the
country.&nbsp; Since his time, there has been advance in politics
in Lynn, as well as elsewhere.&nbsp; When the judicious Dod
published his <i>Electoral Facts</i>, the town had one
newspaper&mdash;Conservative, of course&mdash;with a circulation
of 654 copies; now it has a Liberal newspaper as well, and both
papers enjoy a large circulation; and owing to the facilities
afforded by the Great Eastern Railway, Lynn has its London
morning papers down by nine o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; At the period of
the passing of the Reform Act, Lynn had a voting force of
660.&nbsp; One of the best things I saw in Lynn, as I was groping
my way in the uncertain light, was the fine schoolroom of the
Congregational Church, filled with a cluster of clean, happy
looking girls, all hard at work sewing.&nbsp; I knew no living
soul.&nbsp; I felt I was an intruder, and popped out as speedily
as I popped in; but I have the picture <a name="page47"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 47</span>before me as I write, of happy girls
under the sanction of the Christian Church, preserved from the
contagion of the streets, learning to work.&nbsp; Christianity
has been dogmatic long enough, a little mild and benevolent
socialism will not do it much harm.&nbsp; This old world town may
be described as a city of churches, and one of its most
characteristic remains is Road Mount Chapel, a curious octangular
structure containing a beautiful but tiny perpendicular
apartment, that once contained the rood of our lady of
Lynn.&nbsp; Every schoolboy knows how unwarily, King John nearly
lost his life in crossing Lynn Wash, and did lose all his
baggage, devoured by the unexpected flood.</p>

FRAMLINGHAM AND ITS CASTLE.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;I <span class="smcap">often</span> wonder,&rdquo; said
a local tradesman to me the other day as I was contemplating the
majestic ruins of Framlingham Castle and the seat of power in the
Eastern Counties, &ldquo;that the Great Eastern Railway does not
run excursion trains here.&rdquo;&nbsp; I must own that I shared
in that feeling.&nbsp; I am sure thousands would rush from town
to see the place if they had a day excursion there.&nbsp; The
railway in question has done a good deal for Framlingham.&nbsp;
When I knew it as a lad it was out of the world altogether.&nbsp;
It laid quite off the turnpike road.&nbsp; To get to London a
Framlingham resident had to make his way to Wickham Market.&nbsp;
Now it has a railway to itself, and that railway takes you to
London, and thus makes Framlingham a living part of the British
Empire of to-day.&nbsp; In one respect this has been a great gain
for the town, as it led to the establishment, in 1864, of the
Albert Memorial College, a handsome pile of buildings adapted for
the accommodation of 500 boys.&nbsp; The object of the
institution is to provide for the middle classes, at a moderate
cost, a practical training, which shall prepare the pupils for
the active duties of agricultural, manufacturing, and commercial
life, and qualification for the Civil Service and other
competitive examinations.&nbsp; The religious instruction is in
accordance with the doctrines and practice of the Church of
England.&nbsp; But I am glad to find that there is a conscience
clause for the sons of Dissenters who are exempted from Church of
England teaching <a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
49</span>and from Sunday attendance at the parish church or
college chapel.&nbsp; It speaks well for the school that, though
at one time it was in a declining state, for the last few years
it has been in a very prosperous condition.&nbsp; It is
interesting, as you stand on the lawn in front of the college and
look at the decaying ruins of Framlingham Castle, to note how we
have swept into a younger day.&nbsp; Ages have passed away since
Hugh Bigod lived there; indeed, the origin of the castle is
somewhat obscure.&nbsp; Its last royal occupant was Queen
Mary.&nbsp; Thence she proceeded in state to take possession of
her crown, amidst crowds of misguided men, who had rallied round
her standard in the hope that she would respect the work of
Reformation begun by her father, and continued by her
brother.&nbsp; When the castle was built, brute force ruled the
land.&nbsp; When the new college was erected, it had come to be
understood that knowledge was power.&nbsp; The college
flourishes; the old castle is a ruin.&nbsp; The world moves,
after all.</p>
<p>I find Framlingham itself but little changed.&nbsp; There was
a barber who, in my youth, had a picture of Absalom caught by his
hair in the wood, while David cries&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Oh, Absalom, my son, my son,<br />
Thou wouldst not have died,<br />
Hadst thou a periwig on!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&mdash;That barber is no more, and I know not what has become
of his sign.&nbsp; As an object lesson in history, undying
interest attaches to Framlingham Castle and its adjacent
church.&nbsp; The castle must have been one of the largest in
England.&nbsp; As our Quaker poet, Bernard Barton,
wrote&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Still stand thy battlemented towers,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Firm as in bygone years;<br />
As if within yet ruled the powers<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of England&rsquo;s haughtiest peers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When I first knew the castle it was used as a
poor-house.&nbsp; The home of the Bigods and the Howards is <a
name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>utilised in
this way no longer.&nbsp; The castle hall is now devoted to the
recovery of small debts and other equally local matters.&nbsp; In
the good old times the nobles settled debts, small or great, in a
much easier way.</p>
<p>The church was erected by one of the Mowbrays, and the tower,
which is a handsome one, and from the top of which, on a clear
day, you get a view as far as Aldeburgh, contains a clock
presented by Sir Henry Thompson, our great surgeon, in memory of
his father, a highly-respected inhabitant of Framlingham, who did
much for the Congregational cause in that town.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sir
Henry Thompson was my Sunday School teacher,&rdquo; said an
intelligent tradesman to me, &ldquo;and I have the book in which
he signed his name as having taken the Temperance
Pledge.&rdquo;&nbsp; Framlingham&mdash;let me state by way of
parenthesis&mdash;early gave in her adhesion to the Temperance
movement.&nbsp; In the cemetery there is a monument to a worthy
inhabitant of the name of Larner.&nbsp; He was the great Apostle
of Temperance in the Eastern Counties.&nbsp; &ldquo;He was for
years,&rdquo; Mr. Thomas Whittaker writes, in his <i>Life&rsquo;s
Battles in Temperance Armour</i>, &ldquo;the man of Suffolk, the
moving power, the undaunted spirit, the unwearied defender; and
when it is remembered how special were the difficulties and how
numerous the foes, the way in which he brought the whole district
under his influence, and even to treat him with loving respect,
it is the more remarkable.&nbsp; When he died the heart pulsation
seemed to stop.&rdquo;&nbsp; Out of the world as Framlingham is,
and old-fashioned as is the town even to this day, there is a
good deal of life in it, and especially so in religious
matters.&nbsp; Including the college chapel, there are nine
places of worship in it, for a population not much over two
thousand.&nbsp; As far as I can make out, the Salvation Army
here, as elsewhere, has helped to thin the attendance at most of
the existing places of worship.&nbsp; If they can show a more
excellent way it is rather a reflection upon the existing pulpits
of the place.&nbsp; In spite of the Salvation Army, I met a man
in the street who complained to me that Framlingham was
dull.&nbsp; &ldquo;You <a name="page51"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 51</span>see, sir,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;we
are in an agriculturists&rsquo; district, and the farmers
ha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t got any money.&rdquo;&nbsp; It seems to me
that they ought to have&mdash;at any rate, the public has to pay
quite enough for its beef and mutton, and such farming produce as
butter, and milk, and eggs.&nbsp; One odd thing in Framlingham is
a tomb in a garden, which you pass on your way from the station,
which preserves the memory of one Thomas Mills, a native, who
seems to have made money, which he bequeathed to charitable
purposes.&nbsp; Normans and Saxons seem to have had between them
a good deal to do with Framlingham Castle and Church.&nbsp; At
one time or other one of the parsons connected with the place was
Catholic and Protestant, and thus went with the times.&nbsp; At a
later period one had a more sensitive conscience, and was one of
the ejected.&nbsp; Framlingham, like most English towns, seems to
have been inhabited by all sorts and conditions of men.&nbsp; But
its castle ought to be a rare place for excursionists to visit,
and the country round is rich in rural charms.&nbsp; In the
world, Framlingham, now that its castle is a ruin, and the power
of the feudal lords gone, does not seem to have done much.&nbsp;
It has had its day, and that day with its lords and ladies, and
fighting men, must have been a grand one.&nbsp; Perhaps
it&rsquo;s as well that they</p>
<blockquote><p>Sleep the sleep that knows no breaking,<br />
Morn of toil, nor night of waiting.</p>

/>
SUDBURY.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the year 1727 there was born in
Sudbury, and baptized in the Independent Meeting there, Thomas
Gainsborough, one of the earliest and the greatest of English
painters.&nbsp; The family were Dissenters, and in the
meeting-house, now under the care of the Rev. Ira Bosely, who
seems very happy and successful in his new sphere of labour, are
the memorials of two of them who were buried in the graveyard
attached.&nbsp; There are two bequests of the Gainsborough family
for the support of the minister for the time being, of which the
present incumbent made favourable mention when I saw him the
other day, in the comfortable manse attached to the
meeting-house.&nbsp; One of the items in the ancient account-book
seemed to be curious.&nbsp; It was as follows: &ldquo;Four
shillings for tobacco.&rdquo;&nbsp; I have only to assume in the
good old times our pious ancestors had an idea of Pleasant Sunday
Afternoon Services, and for that purpose possibly the tobacco had
been acquired.&nbsp; Be that as it may, we may be sure the
Gainsborough family were as remarkable as any that then attended
on the means of grace.&nbsp; In person, Mr. Gainsborough&rsquo;s
father is represented as a fine old man, who wore his hair
carefully parted, and was remarkable for the whiteness and
regularity of his teeth.&nbsp; According to the custom of the
last century he always wore a sword and was an adroit fencer,
possessing the fatal facility of using the weapon in either
hand.&nbsp; He introduced into Sudbury the straw trade from
Coventry, and <a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
53</span>he managed to keep it in his own hands.&nbsp; He had a
large family of five sons and four daughters.&nbsp; One of the
latter married a Dissenting Minister at Bath.&nbsp; One son,
John, was a great mechanical genius, and invented wings, by means
of which he essayed to fly, but, to the amusement of the
spectators, found himself, instead of soaring into the air,
dropped in a ditch by the way.&nbsp; Humphrey Gainsborough, the
painter&rsquo;s second brother, settled as a Dissenting Minister
at Henley-on-Thames.&nbsp; Of him, the celebrated Edgeworth, the
father of the equally celebrated daughter, says he had never
known a man of a more inventive mind.&nbsp; Thomas, the artist,
must have inherited something of his artistic skill from his
mother, for she herself loved to paint fruit and flowers, but
with the boy, painting became the one great object of his life,
and he was always at it, even when he should have been studying
at the ancient grammar school where he was a pupil; and thus it
is Sudbury has two great men to boast of&mdash;Thomas
Gainsborough, the artist, and Simon de Sudbury, Archbishop of
Canterbury, who was beheaded by the populace in Wat Tyler&rsquo;s
rebellion, and whose skull is still shown you in St.
Gregory&rsquo;s Church.&nbsp; I have known many thick skulls in
East Anglia, but surely that of the martyred Archbishop must have
been one of the thickest to have lasted all this time.</p>
<p>Sudbury was the painter&rsquo;s studio.&nbsp; It is now a
clean, well-built, and slightly uninteresting provincial town,
with a population of about eight thousand.&nbsp; But, said a
commercial traveller to me, as I was deploring the barrenness of
the land, &ldquo;It is a good place for business.&rdquo;&nbsp; It
lies in the flat country of the valley of the Stour, a river
which expands into a lake when the waters are out.&nbsp; When
Gainsborough was a boy it was ancient and picturesque&mdash;and
dirty.&nbsp; At any rate it is thus described in a poem written
by Daniel Herbert, one of the old Noncons., a bunting
manufacturer, and occasional preacher in the old meeting-house,
who tells us</p>
<blockquote><p>I live at Sudbury, that dirty place,<br />
Where are a few poor sinners saved by grace.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
54</span>&mdash;Well, the dirt is gone; but when as late as the
disfranchisement of the burgh, for bribery and corruption, which
took place early in the reign of Queen Victoria, when the free
and independent returned to Parliament a gentleman of colour,
renowned for his vanity and wealth, it was evident that a good
many poor sinners remained who had not been saved by grace.</p>
<p>Allan Cunningham treats the marriage of Gainsborough as all
conventional writers do.&nbsp; The lady&mdash;her name was
Margaret Burr, and she had &pound;200 a year of her
own&mdash;made Gainsborough &ldquo;a prudent, a kind, and a
submissive wife.&rdquo;&nbsp; As the lady was but sixteen, and
her husband was eighteen, at the time of their wedding, one
cannot be surprised to find at a later period Gainsborough
looking upon his wife as a somewhat unsuitable companion.&nbsp;
Cunningham writes, &ldquo;The courtship was short.&nbsp; The
young pair left Sudbury, leased a small house at a rent of
&pound;24 a year in Ipswich, and, making themselves happy in
mutual love, conceived they were settled for life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sudbury was the birth-place of Enfield, whose <i>Speaker</i>
was a well-known text book in the past generation.&nbsp; Then our
William Durbyn, author of the well-known <i>Commentary on the
Epistle of Jude</i>, was also born there.&nbsp; He died a martyr
for the truth&rsquo;s sake in Newgate in 1685.&nbsp; The Grammar
School of Sudbury dates as far back as 1591.&nbsp; Protestant as
the town was, the Sudbury burghers marched to Framlingham to
defend Mary&rsquo;s rights against the attempted usurpation of
Northumberland and his faction, she assuring them of her
protection in the observance of their religion&mdash;a promise
she shamefully failed to keep.&nbsp; It seems that Wilson, the
Sudbury lecturer and preacher, was so harassed by the Bishop and
Archbishop, that with Winthrop, afterwards Governor of
Massachusetts, he went over with a large band of the later
Pilgrim Fathers to New England.&nbsp; Sudbury itself at one time
seems to have rejoiced in a Christian toleration as refreshing as
it was rare.&nbsp; In 1670, or thereabouts, it <a
name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>was the
practice of the Nonconformists to preach in All Saints Church,
while one of the early pastors of the Congregational Church lived
with his family in All Saints Vicarage for eleven years.&nbsp; It
appears from the town records that this church was without a
regular incumbent for a long time, and that after the Dutch war,
the church was used as a prison for the Dutch prisoners, there
being at one time 500 of them quartered in the town.</p>
<p>The country round the old town&mdash;the town of
Gainsborough&rsquo;s boyhood&mdash;must have been singularly
picturesque.&nbsp; The boy painter saw in it a beauty which he
never forget; he told Thicknesse, his first patron, that
&ldquo;there was not a picturesque clump of trees, nor even a
single tree of any beauty; no, nor hedge-row, stem or
root,&rdquo; in or around his native town, which was not from his
earliest years treasured in his memory.&nbsp; It is interesting
to note the painter&rsquo;s progress.&nbsp; As you walk from the
railway you come to Friar Street, where the painter married and
took a house for a short while.&nbsp; A few steps further on
bring you to Sepulchre Street, and you see the site of the house
where he was born, opposite which is now the Christopher
Inn.&nbsp; There was a large garden behind the house; and it was
there the young artist sketched the face of the culprit whom he
watched steal his father&rsquo;s pears.&nbsp; That was his first
attempt at portrait-painting, and a very successful one, as it
led to the conviction of the culprit.&nbsp; The Pear Tree is
still shown.&nbsp; Apparently Sudbury is famous for its
pears.&nbsp; I saw many of them in the gardens belonging to some
of the better houses.&nbsp; It was a pleasure for me to attempt
to follow in the artist&rsquo;s steps.&nbsp; For instance, I made
my way to Brandon Wood, where the poet loved to go
sketching.&nbsp; If the town is improved so as to be almost
unrecognisable, the features of the country remain the same;
nature builds more enduringly than man.&nbsp; There are trees in
Brandon Wood that might have been there in Gainsborough&rsquo;s
time.&nbsp; Over the Essex border, a couple of miles off, is a
landscape which still remains as it is drawn in our National <a
name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
56</span>Gallery.&nbsp; His paintings of a view near Sudbury and
a neighbouring church are more or less still true to life.</p>
<p>Modern Sudbury seems to know but little of her most
distinguished son.&nbsp; It is true that he left it at the age of
eighteen to take up his residence at Ipswich, then at Bath, and
afterwards in London, where he was somewhat of a rival to Sir
Joshua Reynolds, and where he achieved fame and fortune as one of
the founders of the Royal Academy.&nbsp; It is true that he
sleeps not on the banks of the Stour, but on those of the Royal
Thames at Kew, the village dear to his patron, George III.&nbsp;
But Sudbury is singularly careless of the artist&rsquo;s
memory.&nbsp; As I passed the Liberal Club I accosted a
respectable individual&mdash;I assume he was such, as he was
evidently a member of the club&mdash;and in answer to my
enquiries (he was an elderly man) he said, &ldquo;I have lived in
Sudbury all my life, and have no idea where Gainsborough was
born,&rdquo; but he did point me out the residence of Mr. Duport,
a relative of the artist&rsquo;s, and where some of his family
portraits were preserved; but I am unable to state whether they
are there now, as the house was shut up.&nbsp; There ought to be
a good many of Gainsborough&rsquo;s early attempts to be found in
Sudbury, as he was very liberal in giving them to his
friends.&nbsp; It is not too late for Sudbury to wipe off the
reproach of her neglect.&nbsp; It is not too late to mark the
sites illustrated by his genius; or to do honour to the memory of
her greatest glory; or to show to the lads of the Grammar School
there what one of its alumni did, and how he did it, and what he
became.&nbsp; In these days culture and education are supposed to
work wonders.&nbsp; In the career of Gainsborough, we note the
success of one who had little of either, but who did wonders,
nevertheless, by his industry and genius alone.&nbsp; We may note
that after Gainsborough left his native town he rarely seems to
have visited the place, only occasionally to give his vote on the
Tory side.</p>
<p>There may yet be letters of Gainsborough to appear, to
interest the reading public.&nbsp; The latest published is that
which Mr. Redgrave has reprinted.&nbsp; It bears the <a
name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>date of
1776.&nbsp; It was written to his sister in what Mr. Redgrave
describes as a clear, graceful hand.&nbsp; It throws a little
light on his character.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;What will become of me, time must show; I
can only say that my present position with regard to
encouragement is all that heart can wish; but as all worldly
success is precarious, I don&rsquo;t build happiness or the
expectation of it upon present appearances.&nbsp; I have built
upon sandy foundations all my life long.&nbsp; All I know is that
I live at a full thousand a year&rsquo;s expense, and will work
hard and do my best to get through withal; and if that will not
do let them take their lot of blame and suffering that fall short
of their duty both towards me and themselves.&nbsp; Had I been
blessed with your penetration and blind eyes towards foolish
pleasures, I had steered my course better; but we are born with
different passions and gifts, and I have only to hope that the
great Giver of all will make better allowances for us than we
make for one another.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So far it is clear Gainsborough feels the helpless and
unsatisfactory character of his past life.&nbsp; We then have an
insight&mdash;not very pleasant&mdash;into his family
relationships.&nbsp; He speaks of his wife as &ldquo;weak and
good, and never much forward to humour his
happiness.&rdquo;&nbsp; His eldest daughter, Peggy, &ldquo;is a
sensible good girl, but insolent and proud in her behaviour to me
at times.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then his second daughter, Molly, he
detects apparently writing letters to a Mr. Fischer, against whom
the painter had long been on his guard.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have never
suffered that worthy gentleman ever to be in their company since
I came to London, and behold, while I had my eye upon Peggy, the
other slyboots has, I suppose, been the object all
along.&rdquo;&nbsp; And Molly wins the day and marries Mr.
Fischer after all.&nbsp; Of domestic felicity the great artist
seems to have had but a small share.&nbsp; Perhaps that was his
own fault.</p>
<p>Sudbury ought to be more patronised than it is.&nbsp; Its
river affords ample opportunities for boating; and it has a
Temperance Hotel&mdash;perhaps the best in all
Suffolk&mdash;where the tourist may rest and be thankful.</p>

INTERNATIONAL HAVERHILL.</h2>
<blockquote><p>As tenants of uncertain stay,<br />
So may we live our little day<br />
That only grateful hearts shall fill<br />
The homes we leave in Haverhill.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Thus</span> writes the poet Whittier, in
celebration of the 250th anniversary of the City of Haverhill in
America.&nbsp; Most of us know there is a Haverhill in England,
where resided Mr. D. Gurteen, who died recently in his
eighty-fourth year, one of the grand old men&mdash;occasionally
met with&mdash;who have spent all their lives in promoting the
best interests, moral and pecuniary, of the community amongst
whom they live.&nbsp; He was born when Haverhill was in a state
of decay, its chief manufacture, that of silk, having dwindled
all to nothing.&nbsp; He has almost rebuilt the place, and made
it one of the most prosperous of our East Anglian towns.&nbsp;
Haverhill, in a remote corner of East Anglia, is intimately
connected with the American Haverhill.&nbsp; That was founded by
the grandson of a well-known Haverhill clergyman&mdash;Rev. John
Ward&mdash;one of the early Puritans who suffered for conscience
sake, and against whom Romanising archbishops like Laud&mdash;in
whose seat the present Archbishop of London tells us he is proud
to be placed&mdash;made constant war.&nbsp; John Ward, whose
monument is still to be seen in Haverhill Church, had a
descendant named Nathaniel, who was educated at Cambridge, and
went out into the wilderness of New England rather than remain
the victim of persecution in the old country.&nbsp; He was a ripe
scholar, and a man of <a name="page59"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 59</span>great practical ability, a Puritan of
the Puritans, who helped to mould the character and make the laws
of the people of whom he became the minister.&nbsp; The hardy
settlers, who had hitherto toiled in hope, overjoyed at
Ward&rsquo;s coming, insisted on naming their
plantation&mdash;hitherto called Pentucket, after the Indian
tribe who had lived there till bought out by the
whites&mdash;Haverhill, from the birthplace of their honoured
minister.&nbsp; In the recent celebration Haverhill in England
was not forgotten.&nbsp; Mr. Alderman Gurteen and the rector were
invited.&nbsp; The rector could not go.&nbsp; Mr. Alderman
Gurteen could, and he crossed the Atlantic, bearing with him an
address, handsomely got up, to the New England Haverhill.&nbsp;
He was received with open arms, and on his return was honoured
with a dinner in the Town Hall, presided over by his respected
father, Mr. D. Gurteen, J.P., and there he delivered himself of
his American experiences, and was listened to eagerly by a
sympathetic audience, among whom I had the good luck to be
one.</p>
<p>New Haverhill stands on the banks of the Merrimack, at a
distance of some sixteen miles from the sea.&nbsp; The Merrimack
deserves a line as the most noted water-power stream in the
world.&nbsp; Haverhill lies on the north edge of Essex county,
itself the north-eastern corner of Massachusetts.&nbsp; In the
Haverhill of to-day there are over 250 firms engaged in the
manufacture of shoes, and giving employment to 18,000 operatives,
and distributing annually over 2,225,000 dollars in wages, and
shipping 300,000 cases of completed boots and shoes.&nbsp; It is
a big city, thirty-three miles off Boston by rail.&nbsp; The
situation is picturesque, with an undulating surface, watered by
lovely lakes and the glorious river.&nbsp; Haverhill rejoices in
a Town Hall, one of the handsomest of its kind in New England,
and twenty-four church organisations divided among eleven
different denominations.&nbsp; No city in the commonwealth has
grown so fast within the last ten years.&nbsp; I learn from a
local paper that its population is &ldquo;energetic, prosperous,
and cultivated.&rdquo;&nbsp; One of the things which seem to have
struck <a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>Mr.
Alderman Gurteen, as indeed it would some of us, was a handsome
and commodious building known as the Old Ladies&rsquo; Home,
intended to provide for such women as need it, a home in their
declining years.&nbsp; Again, there is a Children&rsquo;s Aid
Society, formed and managed by women, to furnish a real home for
destitute children.&nbsp; Haverhill has also a noble hospital,
where almost every religious society in the city supports free
beds.&nbsp; Such is the Haverhill of to-day.&nbsp; It has
suffered from fire; from Indians, who rushed through it with
their murderous tomahawks: (one of the things Mr. Alderman
Gurteen was taken to see at the exhibition in connection with the
anniversary, was the basket of grass in which Hannah Duston, one
of Haverhill&rsquo;s ancient heroines, carried the scalps of the
Indians in the course of an unnatural conflict with the
English).&nbsp; It was, too, a little Haverhill girl, saved in a
cellar from massacre of the Indians by a negro girl, that was the
ancestress of John Lothrop Motley.&nbsp; The whole world owes
Haverhill much.</p>
<p>Of course, Mr. Alderman Gurteen was taken to see Whittier, the
poet, who lived in a house with his three cousins and a little
niece at Haverhill, where they yet show you the photograph of the
cottage in which he was born, and the barn-like school in which
he was educated.&nbsp; The poet, he has passed away since this
was written, at the ripe age of eighty-two, enjoyed life; took an
interest in all that passes, and, tall and thin, certainly did
not look his age.&nbsp; He had written for the celebration a poem
from which I have quoted above.&nbsp; Haverhill is proud of her
shoes&mdash;but of her poet more.&nbsp; His way of life is
familiar to them all&mdash;his early hours, his simple habits,
his pet squirrels, who come to be fed, his plain living, and high
thinking.&nbsp; He is a Quaker in speech, and talks to Englishmen
of Henry Vincent, whom he knew, and George Thompson, with whom he
fought for the anti-slavery cause.&nbsp; He is a charming old
man, says Mr. Gurteen, and upright as a dart.&nbsp; He was much
interested in the address from the English Haverhill.&nbsp; In
fact, all whom Mr. Gurteen met with <a name="page61"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 61</span>in his international trip acted as
friends.&nbsp; They were, he says, a downright good lot of men
and women, and what pleased him most was their devotion to the
old country.&nbsp; He was delighted with everything he saw,
&ldquo;They are a right noble people, and our sort to a
T.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was the same everywhere.&nbsp; For instance,
at Albany Mr. Gurteen and his daughter (who I should have said,
accompanied him, and was as much charmed with America as he was)
put their heads into a chapel, which happened to be open, and
were accosted by a gentleman, with the remark that there was
&ldquo;no service to-night.&rdquo;&nbsp; He told him in return
that he was a stranger, and had only looked in from
curiosity.&nbsp; &ldquo;Where from&rdquo;? he asked, and when the
reply was &ldquo;England,&rdquo; the gentleman put out both
hands, and said, &ldquo;Welcome, welcome; I am glad to shake
hands with any one from the old country,&rdquo; and lit up the
whole place in the twinkling of an eye.</p>
<p>Am I not right in calling such a visit an international
one?&nbsp; Such visits are the true peacemakers, and strengthen
the bonds of unity between nations better than can be done in any
other way.&nbsp; Mr. Alderman Gurteen is a fair representative of
what is best in a social and commercial and political and
religious life.&nbsp; Old Haverhill could not have sent the new
Haverhill a better specimen of the English citizen of
to-day.&nbsp; The more we send such men to America on
international visits, and the more America sends such men to
us&mdash;whatever politicians on both sides the Atlantic may say
or do to create bad feeling&mdash;the stronger and more lasting
will be the tie that makes England and America&mdash;mother and
daughter&mdash;one in heart and aim.&nbsp; Haverhill is deeply
associated with Puritan History and the Pilgrim Fathers.&nbsp;
Its greatest preacher was the Rev. John Ward, who is still
commemorated by a tomb in Haverhill Church.&nbsp; One of his
sons, Samuel, was a town preacher to the Corporation of Ipswich
for thirty years.&nbsp; Another celebrated preacher was the
saintly Samuel Fairclough, who was born at Haverhill in 1594, and
passed from Cambridge <a name="page62"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 62</span>University to become successively
Lecturer at Lynn and Clare, which latter post he vacated to
become Rector of Kedington, until he was ejected thence in 1692
by the iniquitous Act of Uniformity.</p>
<p>Our Essex Haverhill may be quoted as a remarkable illustration
of what a man can do for his native town.&nbsp; The late Mr.
Gurteen was often called the King of Haverhill, this title being
based upon the fact that he was practically the maker of that
flourishing town.&nbsp; The firm of which he was the head employ
three thousand hands in the manufacture of drabbets and other
fabrics, both linen and cotton, and in the making-up of clothes
for the home and export trade.&nbsp; Mr. Gurteen&rsquo;s
liberality was commensurate with his business success.&nbsp; He
presented the inhabitants with a Town Hall, costing &pound;5,000,
as a thank-offering on the jubilee of his wedding-day; built a
Congregational Church at something like the same expenditure, and
was the originator and principal supporter of many other
improvements for the benefit of his native town.</p>

THE OLDEST ESSEX BOROUGH.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">One</span> of the famous books of the last
generation was that of <i>Dr. Syntax in Search of the
Picturesque</i>.&nbsp; If the Doctor had extended his journey as
far as Maldon, in Essex, he would have been well rewarded for his
pains.&nbsp; Essex can boast of two towns set upon a hill.&nbsp;
One is Colchester, the other is Maldon; but as regards
picturesqueness, Maldon bears away the palm.&nbsp; Everywhere you
have a fine view of the country&mdash;on one side the Chelmer
reaching away to Chelmsford, on the other the Blackwater making
its winding way to the German Ocean.&nbsp; At one time this
Blackwater was a source of trouble, as by means of it the Danes
used to sail up, as it were, into the very bowels of the land,
murdering, and plundering, and ravishing, and pillaging
everywhere.&nbsp; There is no fear of that now; it is a thing of
the past.&nbsp; Said a friend of mine the other day, as we stood
admiring the peaceful prospect lying at our feet, &ldquo;from my
bedroom window I can see eight churches,&rdquo; and, strict
Noncon. as he is, I fancy the sight is pleasanter to him than
that of Danish pirates landing from their ships to carry terror
and devastation all over the land.&nbsp; Maldon claims to be the
oldest borough in Essex, and to have a history, if rather a dull
one.&nbsp; Up to the time of the last Reform Bill it returned two
members, and as a matter of fact, the candidate who bribed most
freely was the winning man.&nbsp; <a name="page64"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 64</span>Now-a-days it is only at an election
that the passions of the people are aroused.&nbsp; There is a
rector who preaches in an ancient church, there is a
Congregational chapel, which I am told is in a flourishing
condition; there are Baptists and Wesleyans, and all work
together pleasantly excepting when an election ensues.&nbsp; Then
the people are aroused, and bad passions come into play, and
friends quarrel never to be friendly again, although the cynical
observer might exclaim&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Strange such difference there should be<br />
&rsquo;Twixt tweedledum and tweedledee.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There was a time when it was otherwise.&nbsp; For instance, in
the reign of Queen Elizabeth, we find the Maldon electors
petitioning their representatives on their sufferings from
Prelatic parsons.&nbsp; &ldquo;They are crueller,&rdquo; so they
affirm, &ldquo;than the ostriches of the wilderness, and more
unkind than the dragons.&rdquo;&nbsp; They ask to be relieved of
the teaching of ungodly men such as have been &ldquo;Popish
priests, taylors, fletchers, serving-men, wheelwrights, and many
of these alehouse haunters, dicers, quarrellers, whoremongers,
and full of gross sins.&rdquo;&nbsp; Moved by this and similar
appeals, the friends of the Puritans in the House of Commons
endeavoured to obtain them some relief, but in vain&mdash;the
Queen and her Bishops were of quite another way of
thinking.&nbsp; For taking their part the Maldon M.P. was
committed to the Tower.&nbsp; Matters became worse rather than
better under James I., and it was not till the Civil War that a
Commission was formed by Parliament for the purpose of
investigating complaints against the existing ministry; and of
that Commission Sir Henry Mildmay, M.P., for Maldon, was
one.&nbsp; Essex was full of Puritan divines.&nbsp; One of these
was Thomas Horrocks, the rector of Maldon, where, says Calamy, he
was &ldquo;a diligent and powerful preacher twelve years
together, and was an instrument for converting many
souls.&rdquo;&nbsp; After his ejectment he continued to preach,
and was at length cast into the dungeon of the town, where he lay
ten days.&nbsp; A court being held in the town, he was accused of
all sorts of crimes, and <a name="page65"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 65</span>called by some of the aldermen
heretic, schismatic, and traitor; and when he was pleading for
himself, one of them rose from the bench and gave him a box on
the ear, and beat off his satin cap.&nbsp; At the time of the
Revolution Mr. Joseph Billio came to Maldon to gather together
under his ministry those whom Mr. Horrocks had prepared for
separation.&nbsp; On the site of the present meeting-house, one
was erected to hold four hundred persons.&nbsp; When Mr. Billio
was succeeded by a minister of Unitarian sentiments, there was a
split in the congregation, and a small place of worship was
erected elsewhere.&nbsp; In 1778 the congregation returned to
their old place of worship.&nbsp; In 1801 a new place of worship
was erected on the site of the old one, which had now become
insufficient.&nbsp; It is there the present minister, the Rev. H.
H. Carlisle, preaches.&nbsp; The place will hold eight hundred
hearers, and is well attended.&nbsp; Attached to it is a fine
modern lecture-hall and day-schools, which are well filled.&nbsp;
I was particularly struck with the bright and happy appearance of
the boys and girls being trained there to become men and
women.&nbsp; With such training the old joke about Essex calves
undoubtedly will lose a good deal of its point and power.</p>
<p>A very quiet place is Maldon&mdash;at one time a great centre
of the corn trade, which, in consequence of railways, has shifted
elsewhere&mdash;and which the Great Eastern Railway has brought
within an hour and a half&rsquo;s ride of London.&nbsp; The
population is about six thousand, and, by the last census, it
seems slightly to have declined.&nbsp; In the Town Hall are
portraits of Queen Elizabeth and Queen Anne, Charles II. and
George III., and Dr. Plume, a Maldon celebrity, of whose career I
have no particulars, save that he was a clergyman, and presented
a library of over 6,000 volumes to the town.&nbsp; It is open
daily from 10 till 12.&nbsp; The great artist, J. R. Herbert,
R.A., was a native of the place, and Landseer studied there in
his early days.&nbsp; Its chief claim to fame seems to have been
that it was the birthplace of Edward Bright, a shopkeeper in the
town, who died in 1750, and was so enormously fat that he weighed
about 616 lbs. <a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
66</span>and seven men were on one occasion buttoned in his
waistcoat without breaking a stitch or straining a button.</p>
<p>Remains around Maldon testify to the antiquity of the
place.&nbsp; On the west side are the remains of a camp formed by
Edward the Elder as far back as 920.&nbsp; Near the town are the
remains of a Lepers&rsquo; Hospital, which makes one note with
thankfulness that, thanks to sanitary science in England, we have
no need of such buildings now, and we rejoice that the good old
times are gone.&nbsp; By the side of the river, about a mile from
the town, are the remains of Beeleigh Abbey, founded for monks of
the Premonstratensian order in 1180; considerable remains still
exist, but have been much altered in the process of converting
the building into a farmhouse, still there is a good deal
remaining well worthy the attention of the antiquary, though at
one time the chapter-house, which has a fine groined roof, was
used as a pig-sty.&nbsp; In the Abbey was buried Henry Bourchier,
Earl of Essex, in 1483.&nbsp; One of the Maldon churches has a
triangular tower.&nbsp; It is said that only in Italy is there
another tower of the same kind.&nbsp; I may also state, as one of
the peculiarities of Maldon, that the custom of Borough English,
by means of which the youngest son succeeds to the copyhold
estates of his father, still prevails there.&nbsp; Thus
altogether a pleasant ancient flavour attaches to the place, in
spite of its Reform Club, which dates from 1874.&nbsp; One might
do worse than live at Maldon, where good houses are to be had at
a bargain, and where in the summer-time, far from the wicked
world, there is a good deal of boating, and where in the winter
time, in the coming glacial era, which Sir Robert Ball
confidently predicts as reserved for the people of England, you
may skate as far as Chelmsford, a consummation by no means
devoutly to be wished.&nbsp; For bicycles Maldon is by no means
favourable, incredible as it may seem to those who will persist
in believing that Essex is a flat country.&nbsp; There are two
hills in the town, one of which is pronounced to be the most
dangerous hill in all Essex for bicyclists.</p>

<h3>EAST ANGLIA</h3>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="GutSmall">BY</span><br
/>
J. EWING RITCHIE.</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;We cordially recommend Mr. Ritchie&rsquo;s
Book to all who wish to pass an agreeable hour and to learn
something of the outward actions and inner life of their
predecessors.&nbsp; It is full of sketches of East Anglian
celebrities, happily touched if lightly
limned.&rsquo;&mdash;<i>East Anglian Daily Times</i>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A very entertaining and enjoyable book.&nbsp; Local
gossip, a wide range of reading and industrious research, have
enabled the author to enliven his pages with a wide diversity of
subjects, specially attractive to East Anglians, but also of much
general interest.&rsquo;&mdash;<i>Daily Chronicle</i>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The work is written in a light gossipy style, and by
reason both of it and of the variety of persons introduced is
interesting.&nbsp; To a Suffolk or Norfolk man it is, of course,
especially attractive.&nbsp; The reader will go through these
pages without being wearied by application.&nbsp; They form a
pleasant and entertaining contribution to county literature, and
&ldquo;East Anglia&rdquo; will, we should think, find its way to
many of the east country bookshelves.&rsquo;&mdash;<i>Suffolk
Chronicle</i>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The book is as readable and attractive a volume of
local chronicles as could be desired.&nbsp; Though all of our
readers may not see &ldquo;eye to eye&rdquo; with Mr. Ritchie, in
regard to political and theological questions, they cannot fail
to gain much enjoyment from his excellent delineation of old days
in East Anglia.&rsquo;&mdash;<i>Norwich Mercury</i>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;East Anglia&rdquo; has the merit of not being a
compilation, which is more than can be said of the great majority
of books produced in these days to satisfy the revived taste for
topographical gossip.&nbsp; Mr. Ritchie is a Suffolk
man&mdash;the son of a Nonconformist minister of Wrentham in that
county&mdash;and he looks back to the old neighbourhood and the
old times with an affection which is likely to communicate itself
to its readers.&nbsp; Altogether we can with confidence recommend
this book not only to East Anglians, but to all readers who have
any affinity for works of its class.&rsquo;&mdash;<i>Daily
News</i>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Ritchie&rsquo;s book belongs to a class of which we
have none too many, for when well done they illustrate
contemporary history in a really charming manner.&nbsp; What with
their past grandeur, their present progress, their martyrs,
patriots, and authors, there is plenty to tell concerning Eastern
counties: and one who writes with native enthusiasm is sure to
command an audience.&rsquo;&mdash;<i>Baptist</i>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Ritchie, known to the numerous readers of the
<i>Christian World</i> as &ldquo;Christopher Crayon,&rdquo; has
the pen of a ready, racy, refreshing writer.&nbsp; He never
writes a dull line, and never for a moment allows our interest to
flag.&nbsp; In the work before us, which is not his first, he is,
I should think, at his best.&nbsp; The volume is the outcome of
extensive reading, many rambles over the districts described, and
of thoughtful observation.&nbsp; We seem to live and move and
have our being in East Anglia.&nbsp; Its folk-lore, its
traditions, its worthies, its memorable events, are all vividly
and charmingly placed before us, and we close the book sorry that
there is no more of it, and wondering why it is that works of a
similar kind have not more frequently
appeared.&rsquo;&mdash;<i>Northern Pioneer</i>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It has yielded us more gratification than any work that
we have read for a considerable time.&nbsp; The book ought to
have a wide circulation in the Eastern counties, and will not
fail to yield profit and delight wherever it find its
way.&rsquo;&mdash;<i>Essex Telegraph</i>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Ritchie has here written a most attractive chapter
of autobiography.&nbsp; He recalls the scenes of his early days,
and whatever was quaint or striking in connection with them, and
finds in his recollections ready pegs on which to hang historical
incident and antiquarian curiosities of many kinds.&nbsp; He
passes from point to point in a delightfully cheerful and
contagious mood.&nbsp; Mr. Ritchie&rsquo;s reading has been as
extensive and careful as his observation is keen and his temper
genial; and his pages, which appeared in <i>The Christian World
Magazine</i>, well deserve the honour of book-form, with the
additions he his been able to make to
them.&rsquo;&mdash;<i>British Quarterly Review</i>.</p>

  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary 
Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
